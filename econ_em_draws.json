Variational Inference is gaining popularity and\nattention as a robust approach for Bayesian inference in complex machine\nlearning models; however, its adoption in econometrics and finance is limited.\nThis paper discusses the extent to which Variational Inference constitutes a\nreliable and feasible alternative to Monte Carlo sampling for Bayesian\ninference in GARCH-like models. Through a large-scale experiment involving the\nconstituents of the S&amp;P 500 index, several Variational Inference optimizers, a\nvariety of volatility models, and a case study, we show that Variational\nInference is an attractive, remarkably well-calibrated, and competitive method\nfor Bayesian learning."}, "http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03521": {"title": "Cutting Feedback in Misspecified Copula Models", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03521", "description": "In copula models the marginal distributions and copula function are specified\nseparately. We treat these as two modules in a modular Bayesian inference\nframework, and propose conducting modified Bayesian inference by ``cutting\nfeedback''. Cutting feedback limits the influence of potentially misspecified\nmodules in posterior inference. We consider two types of cuts. The first limits\nthe influence of a misspecified copula on inference for the marginals, which is\na Bayesian analogue of the popular Inference for Margins (IFM) estimator. The\nsecond limits the influence of misspecified marginals on inference for the\ncopula parameters by using a rank likelihood to define the cut model. We\nestablish that if only one of the modules is misspecified, then the appropriate\ncut posterior gives accurate uncertainty quantification asymptotically for the\nparameters in the other module. Computation of the cut posteriors is difficult,\nand new variational inference methods to do so are proposed. The efficacy of\nthe new methodology is demonstrated using both simulated data and a substantive\nmultivariate time series application from macroeconomic forecasting. In the\nlatter, cutting feedback from misspecified marginals to a 1096 dimension copula\nimproves posterior inference and predictive accuracy greatly, compared to\nconventional Bayesian inference."}, "http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04345": {"title": "Joint diagnostic test of regression discontinuity designs: multiple testing problem", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04345", "description": "Current diagnostic tests for regression discontinuity (RD) design face a\nmultiple testing problem. We find a massive over-rejection of the identifying\nrestriction among empirical RD studies published in top-five economics\njournals. Each test achieves a nominal size of 5%; however, the median number\nof tests per study is 12. Consequently, more than one-third of studies reject\nat least one of these tests and their diagnostic procedures are invalid for\njustifying the identifying assumption. We offer a joint testing procedure to\nresolve the multiple testing problem. Our procedure is based on a new joint\nasymptotic normality of local linear estimates and local polynomial density\nestimates. In simulation studies, our joint testing procedures outperform the\nBonferroni correction. We implement the procedure as an R package, rdtest, with\ntwo empirical examples in its vignettes."}, "http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04620": {"title": "On the Non-Identification of Revenue Production Functions", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04620", "description": "Production functions are potentially misspecified when revenue is used as a\nproxy for output. I formalize and strengthen this common knowledge by showing\nthat neither the production function nor Hicks-neutral productivity can be\nidentified with such a revenue proxy.

The test provides a means\nto assess the suitability of the classical dense factor regression model\ncompared to a sparse plus dense alternative augmenting factor regression with\nidiosyncratic shocks. Our proposed test does not require tuning parameters,\neliminates the need to estimate covariance matrices, and offers simplicity in\nimplementation. The validity of the test is theoretically established under\ntime-series dependence. Through simulation experiments, we demonstrate the\nfavorable finite sample performance of our procedure. Moreover, using the\nFRED-MD dataset, we apply the test and reject the adequacy of the classical\nfactor regression model when the dependent variable is inflation but not when\nit is industrial production. These findings offer insights into selecting\nappropriate models for high-dimensional datasets."}}
