In a couple of recent, companion papers they have\nbeen successfully integrated within the framework induced by the constrained\nminimisation of the Kullback-Leibler divergence: specifically, two, broad\nclasses of models have been devised, i.e. the integrated and the conditional\nones, defined by different, probabilistic rules to place links, load them with\nweights and turn them into proper, econometric prescriptions. Still, the\nrecipes adopted by the two approaches to estimate the parameters entering into\nthe definition of each model differ. In econometrics, a likelihood that\ndecouples the binary and weighted parts of a model, treating a network as\ndeterministic, is typically maximised; to restore its random character, two\nalternatives exist: either solving the likelihood maximisation on each\nconfiguration of the ensemble and taking the average of the parameters\nafterwards or taking the average of the likelihood function and maximising the\nlatter one. The difference between these approaches lies in the order in which\nthe operations of averaging and maximisation are taken - a difference that is\nreminiscent of the quenched and annealed ways of averaging out the disorder in\nspin glasses. The results of the present contribution, devoted to comparing\nthese recipes in the case of continuous, conditional network models, indicate\nthat the annealed estimation recipe represents the best alternative to the\ndeterministic one."}, "http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01284": {"title": "Does regional variation in wage levels identify the effects of a national minimum wage?", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01284", "description": "This paper examines the identification assumptions underlying two types of\nestimators of the causal effects of minimum wages based on regional variation\nin wage levels: the \"effective minimum wage\" and the \"fraction affected/gap\"\ndesigns.
