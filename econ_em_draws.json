Variational Inference is gaining popularity and\nattention as a robust approach for Bayesian inference in complex machine\nlearning models; however, its adoption in econometrics and finance is limited.\nThis paper discusses the extent to which Variational Inference constitutes a\nreliable and feasible alternative to Monte Carlo sampling for Bayesian\ninference in GARCH-like models. Through a large-scale experiment involving the\nconstituents of the S&amp;P 500 index, several Variational Inference optimizers, a\nvariety of volatility models, and a case study, we show that Variational\nInference is an attractive, remarkably well-calibrated, and competitive method\nfor Bayesian learning."}, "http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03521": {"title": "Cutting Feedback in Misspecified Copula Models", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03521", "description": "In copula models the marginal distributions and copula function are specified\nseparately. We treat these as two modules in a modular Bayesian inference\nframework, and propose conducting modified Bayesian inference by ``cutting\nfeedback''. Cutting feedback limits the influence of potentially misspecified\nmodules in posterior inference. We consider two types of cuts. The first limits\nthe influence of a misspecified copula on inference for the marginals, which is\na Bayesian analogue of the popular Inference for Margins (IFM) estimator. The\nsecond limits the influence of misspecified marginals on inference for the\ncopula parameters by using a rank likelihood to define the cut model. We\nestablish that if only one of the modules is misspecified, then the appropriate\ncut posterior gives accurate uncertainty quantification asymptotically for the\nparameters in the other module. Computation of the cut posteriors is difficult,\nand new variational inference methods to do so are proposed. The efficacy of\nthe new methodology is demonstrated using both simulated data and a substantive\nmultivariate time series application from macroeconomic forecasting. In the\nlatter, cutting feedback from misspecified marginals to a 1096 dimension copula\nimproves posterior inference and predictive accuracy greatly, compared to\nconventional Bayesian inference."}, "http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04345": {"title": "Joint diagnostic test of regression discontinuity designs: multiple testing problem", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04345", "description": "Current diagnostic tests for regression discontinuity (RD) design face a\nmultiple testing problem.

For web-facing firms\nrunning online A/B tests, however, it still remains challenging in balancing\ncovariate information when experimental subjects arrive sequentially. In this\npaper, we study an online experimental design problem, which we refer to as the\n\"Online Blocking Problem.\" In this problem, experimental subjects with\nheterogeneous covariate information arrive sequentially and must be immediately\nassigned into either the control or the treated group. The objective is to\nminimize the total discrepancy, which is defined as the minimum weight perfect\nmatching between the two groups. To solve this problem, we propose a randomized\ndesign of experiment, which we refer to as the \"Pigeonhole Design.\" The\npigeonhole design first partitions the covariate space into smaller spaces,\nwhich we refer to as pigeonholes, and then, when the experimental subjects\narrive at each pigeonhole, balances the number of control and treated subjects\nfor each pigeonhole. We analyze the theoretical performance of the pigeonhole\ndesign and show its effectiveness by comparing against two well-known benchmark\ndesigns: the match-pair design and the completely randomized design. We\nidentify scenarios when the pigeonhole design demonstrates more benefits over\nthe benchmark design. To conclude, we conduct extensive simulations using\nYahoo! data to show a 10.2% reduction in variance if we use the pigeonhole\ndesign to estimate the average treatment effect."}, "http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04576": {"title": "Finite Sample Performance of a Conduct Parameter Test in Homogenous Goods Markets", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04576", "description": "We assess the finite sample performance of the conduct parameter test in\nhomogeneous goods markets.
