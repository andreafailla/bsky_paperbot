Inspired by the Predictive,\nDescriptive, Relevant framework of interpretability, we propose causal rule\nlearning which finds a refined set of causal rules characterizing potential\nsubgroups to estimate and enhance our understanding of heterogeneous treatment\neffects. Causal rule learning involves three phases: rule discovery, rule\nselection, and rule analysis. In the rule discovery phase, we utilize a causal\nforest to generate a pool of causal rules with corresponding subgroup average\ntreatment effects. The selection phase then employs a D-learning method to\nselect a subset of these rules to deconstruct individual-level treatment\neffects as a linear combination of the subgroup-level effects. This helps to\nanswer an ignored question by previous literature: what if an individual\nsimultaneously belongs to multiple groups with different average treatment\neffects? The rule analysis phase outlines a detailed procedure to further\nanalyze each rule in the subset from multiple perspectives, revealing the most\npromising rules for further validation. The rules themselves, their\ncorresponding subgroup treatment effects, and their weights in the linear\ncombination give us more insights into heterogeneous treatment effects.\nSimulation and real-world data analysis demonstrate the superior performance of\ncausal rule learning on the interpretable estimation of heterogeneous treatment\neffect when the ground truth is complex and the sample size is sufficient."}, "http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06808": {"title": "Odds are the sign is right", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06808", "description": "This article introduces a new condition based on odds ratios for sensitivity\nanalysis.
