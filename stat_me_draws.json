It has been shown that standard confidence\nintervals for test error using estimates from CV may have coverage below\nnominal levels. This phenomenon occurs because each sample is used in both the\ntraining and testing procedures during CV and as a result, the CV estimates of\nthe errors become correlated. Without accounting for this correlation, the\nestimate of the variance is smaller than it should be. One way to mitigate this\nissue is by estimating the mean squared error of the prediction error instead\nusing nested CV. This approach has been shown to achieve superior coverage\ncompared to intervals derived from standard CV.

For $\\alpha\\in (0,1)$, Bridge regression enjoys several\nstatistical properties of interest such as sparsity and near-unbiasedness of\nthe estimates (Fan and Li, 2001). However, the main difficulty lies in the\nnon-convex nature of the penalty for these values of $\\alpha$, which makes an\noptimization procedure challenging and usually it is only possible to find a\nlocal optimum. To address this issue, Polson et al. (2013) took a sampling\nbased fully Bayesian approach to this problem, using the correspondence between\nthe Bridge penalty and a power exponential prior on the regression\ncoefficients. However, their sampling procedure relies on Markov chain Monte\nCarlo (MCMC) techniques, which are inherently sequential and not scalable to\nlarge problem dimensions. Cross validation approaches are similarly\ncomputation-intensive. To this end, our contribution is a novel\n\\emph{non-iterative} method to fit a Bridge regression model. The main\ncontribution lies in an explicit formula for Stein's unbiased risk estimate for\nthe out of sample prediction risk of Bridge regression, which can then be\noptimized to select the desired tuning parameters, allowing us to completely\nbypass MCMC as well as computation-intensive cross validation approaches.
