These representations have widespread applications in recommendation systems and advertising; however, existing methods typically rely on specific features like text content, activity patterns, or platform metadata, failing to holistically model user behavior across different modalities. To address this limitation, we propose SoMeR, a Social Media user Representation learning framework that incorporates temporal activities, text content, profile information, and network interactions to learn comprehensive user portraits. SoMeR encodes user post streams as sequences of timestamped textual features, uses transformers to embed this along with profile data, and jointly trains with link prediction and contrastive learning objectives to capture user similarity. We demonstrate SoMeR's versatility through two applications: 1) Identifying inauthentic accounts involved in coordinated influence operations by detecting users posting similar content simultaneously, and 2) Measuring increased polarization in online discussions after major events by quantifying how users with different beliefs moved farther apart in the embedding space. SoMeR's ability to holistically model users enables new solutions to important problems around disinformation, societal tensions, and online behavior understanding."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05288": {"title": "Learning Social Graph for Inactive User Recommendation", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05288", "description": "arXiv:2405.05288v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Social relations have been widely incorporated into recommender systems to alleviate data sparsity problem.

As argued recently, however, the mutual information as conventionally defined can return biased results because it neglects the information cost of the so-called contingency table, a crucial component of the similarity calculation. In principle the bias can be rectified by subtracting the appropriate information cost, leading to the modified measure known as the reduced mutual information, but in practice one can only ever compute an upper bound on this information cost, and the value of the reduced mutual information depends crucially on how good a bound is established.

Solutions to the reward placement problem must thus be robust to this uncertainty, by achieving a high utility in all possible networks.

We propose a modeling framework that integrates an epidemiological compartmental model that captures the spread of an infectious disease within a multi-stage stochastic program (MSP) that determines the allocation of critical resources under uncertainty.

In fact, mobility has been a crucial target for early non-pharmaceutical containment measures against the recent COVID-19 pandemic, with a degree of intensity ranging from public transportation line closures to regional, city or even home confinements. Nonetheless, quantitative knowledge on the relationship between mobility-contagions and, consequently, on the efficiency of containment measures remains elusive. Here we introduce an agent-based model with a simple interaction between mobility and contacts. Despite its simplicity our model shows the emergence of a critical mobility level, inducing major outbreaks when surpassed. We explore the interplay between mobility restrictions and the infection in recent intervention policies seen across many countries, and how interventions in the form of closures triggered by incidence rates can guide the epidemic into an oscillatory regime with recurrent waves.

A concise and human-interpretable overview of this information helps decision-makers in implementing efficient and quick disaster response. Existing abstractive summarization approaches can be categorized as sentence-based or key-phrase-based approaches. This paper focuses on sentence-based approach, which is typically implemented as a dual-phase procedure in literature. The initial phase, known as the extractive phase, involves identifying the most relevant tweets. The subsequent phase, referred to as the abstractive phase, entails generating a more human-interpretable summary. In this study, we adopt the methodology from prior research for the extractive phase. For the abstractive phase of summarization, most existing approaches employ deep learning-based frameworks, which can either be pre-trained or require training from scratch. However, to achieve the appropriate level of performance, it is imperative to have substantial training data for both methods, which is not readily available. This work presents an Abstractive Tweet Summarizer (ATSumm) that effectively addresses the issue of data sparsity by using auxiliary information. We introduced the Auxiliary Pointer Generator Network (AuxPGN) model, which utilizes a unique attention mechanism called Key-phrase attention. This attention mechanism incorporates auxiliary information in the form of key-phrases and their corresponding importance scores from the input tweets. We evaluate the proposed approach by comparing it with 10 state-of-the-art approaches across 13 disaster datasets.

One explanation for this is that firms benefit from locating close to their suppliers and customers. However, the emergence of global supply chains shows that physical proximity is not necessarily a prerequisite to successfully manage customer-supplier relations anymore. This raises the question when firms need to colocate in value chains and when they can coordinate over longer distances. We hypothesize that one important aspect is the extent to which supply chain partners exchange not just goods but also know-how. To test this, we build on an expanding literature that studies the drivers of industrial coagglomeration to analyze when supply chain connections lead firms to colocation. We exploit detailed micro-data for the Hungarian economy between 2015 and 2017, linking firm registries, employer-employee matched data and firm-to-firm transaction data from value-added tax records. This allows us to observe colocation, labor flows and value chain connections at the level of firms, as well as construct aggregated coagglomeration patterns, skill relatedness and input-output connections between pairs of industries. We show that supply chains are more likely to support coagglomeration when the industries involved are also skill related. That is, input-output and labor market channels reinforce each other, but supplier connections only matter for colocation when industries have similar labor requirements, suggesting that they employ similar types of know-how. We corroborate this finding by analyzing the interactions between firms, showing that supplier relations are more geographically constrained between companies that operate in skill related industries."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07072": {"title": "Selecting focused digital cohorts from social media using the metric backbone of biomedical knowledge graphs", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07072", "description": "arXiv:2405.07072v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The abundance of social media data allows researchers to construct large digital cohorts to study the interplay between human behavior and medical treatment.

While X (formerly Twitter), Instagram, and Facebook cater to wide ranging topics, Reddit subgroups and dedicated patient advocacy forums trade in much more specific, biomedically-relevant discourse. To hone in on relevant users anywhere, we have developed a general framework and applied it to epilepsy discourse in social media as a test case. We analyzed the text from posts by users who mention epilepsy drugs in the general-purpose social media sites X and Instagram, the epilepsy-focused Reddit subgroup (r/Epilepsy), and the Epilepsy Foundation of America (EFA) forums. We curated a medical terms dictionary and used it to generate a knowledge graph (KG) for each online community. For each KG, we computed the metric backbone--the smallest subgraph that preserves all shortest paths in the network. By comparing the subset of users who contribute to the backbone to the subset who do not, we found that epilepsy-focused social media users contribute to the KG backbone in much higher proportion than do general-purpose social media users. Furthermore, using human annotation of Instagram posts, we demonstrated that users who do not contribute to the backbone are more than twice as likely to use dictionary terms in a manner inconsistent with their biomedical meaning. For biomedical research applications, our backbone-based approach thus has several benefits over simple engagement-based approaches: It can retain low-engagement users who nonetheless contribute meaningful biomedical insights.

Since its introduction, the chart has documented music consumerism through eras of globalization, economic growth, and the emergence of new technologies for music listening. In recent years, musicians and other hitmakers have voiced their worry that the music world is changing: Many claim that it is getting harder to make a hit but until now, the claims have not been backed using chart data. Here we show that the dynamics of the Billboard Hot 100 chart have changed significantly since the chart's founding in 1958, and in particular in the past 15 years. Whereas most songs spend less time on the chart now than songs did in the past, we show that top-1 songs have tripled their chart lifetime since the 1960s, the highest-ranked songs maintain their positions for far longer than previously, and the lowest-ranked songs are replaced more frequently than ever. At the same time, who occupies the chart has also changed over the years: In recent years, fewer new artists make it into the chart and more positions are occupied by established hit makers. Finally, investigating how song chart trajectories have changed over time, we show that historical song trajectories cluster into clear trajectory archetypes characteristic of the time period they were part of.

The opinion dynamics is modeled by a stochastic imitation dynamics in which the individuals copy the opinion of more successful peers. In the infinite population limit, this dynamics is described by the classical replicator equation of evolutionary game theory. The equilibrium solution shows a threshold separating the initial frequencies that lead to the fixation of one opinion or the other. A comparison with Galam's deterministic model reveals contrasting results, especially in the presence of inflexible individuals, who never change their opinions. In particular, the $N$-player game predicts a polarized equilibrium consisting only of extremists.

The process ends when the mutants either fixate (take over the whole population) or go extinct. The fixation probability measures the success of the invasion. To account for environmental heterogeneity, we study a generalization of the Standard process, called the Heterogeneous Moran process. Here, the fitness of each agent is determined both by its type (resident/mutant) and the node it occupies.

This investigation aims to design and evaluate a novel layer on top of recommender systems suited to incorporate relational information and suggest items with a user-defined degree of surprise. We propose a Knowledge Graph (KG) based recommender system by encoding user interactions on item catalogs. Our study explores whether network-level metrics on KGs can influence the degree of surprise in recommendations. We hypothesize that surprisingness correlates with certain network metrics, treating user profiles as subgraphs within a larger catalog KG. The achieved solution reranks recommendations based on their impact on structural graph metrics. Our research contributes to optimizing recommendations to reflect the metrics. We experimentally evaluate our approach on two datasets of LastFM listening histories and synthetic Netflix viewing profiles. We find that reranking items based on complex network metrics leads to a more unexpected and surprising composition of recommendation lists."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08515": {"title": "Precarious Experiences: Citizens' Frustrations, Anxieties and Burdens of an Online Welfare Benefit System", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08515", "description": "arXiv:2405.08515v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: There is a significant overlap between people who are supported by income-related social welfare benefits, often in precarious situations, and those who experience greater digital exclusion.

To overcome these issues, we introduce a method that generates a graph by progressively expanding a single node to a target graph. In each step, nodes and edges are added in a localized manner through denoising diffusion, building first the global structure, and then refining the local details. The local generation avoids modeling the entire joint distribution over all node pairs, achieving substantial computational savings with subquadratic runtime relative to node count while maintaining high expressivity through multiscale generation. Our experiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on well-established benchmark datasets while successfully scaling to graphs with at least 5000 nodes.

Seasonal variations in electricity supply and demand mean that certain times of year, particularly spring to early summer, are best for scheduled maintenance. Seasonality has two important consequences. First, the value of a plant can be 15% higher than what one would naively expect if value were directly proportional to its availability.

Therefore, the use of hypergraphs for addressing the IM problem has been receiving increasing attention. However, identifying the most influential nodes in hypergraphs remains challenging, mainly because nodes and hyperedges are often strongly coupled and correlated. In this paper, to effectively identify the most influential nodes, we first propose a novel hypergraph-independent cascade model that integrates the influences of both node and hyperedge failures. Afterward, we introduce genetic algorithms (GA) to identify the most influential nodes that leverage hypergraph collective influences. In the GA-based method, the hypergraph collective influence is effectively used to initialize the population, thereby enhancing the quality of initial candidate solutions. The designed fitness function considers the joint influences of both nodes and hyperedges. This ensures the optimal set of nodes with the best influence on both nodes and hyperedges to be evaluated accurately. Moreover, a new mutation operator is designed by introducing factors, i.e., the collective influence and overlapping effects of nodes in hypergraphs, to breed high-quality offspring.

However, in signal transfer networks, such as those representing the transfer of light across an interferometer, complex-valued edge weights are needed to represent the manipulation of the signal in both magnitude and phase. These complex-valued edge weights introduce interference into the signal transfer, but it is unknown how such interference affects network properties such as small-worldness. To address this gap, we have introduced a small-world interferometer network model with complex-valued edge weights and generalized existing network measures to define the interferometric clustering coefficient, the apparent path length, and the interferometric small-world coefficient. Using high-performance computing resources, we generated a large set of small-world interferometers over a wide range of parameters in system size, nearest-neighbor count, and edge-weight phase and computed their interferometric network measures. We found that the interferometric small-world coefficient depends significantly on the amount of phase on complex-valued edge weights: for small edge-weight phases, constructive interference led to a higher interferometric small-world coefficient; while larger edge-weight phases induced destructive interference which led to a lower interferometric small-world coefficient. Thus, for the small-world interferometer model, interferometric measures are necessary to capture the effect of interference on signal transfer. This model is an example of the type of problem that necessitates interferometric measures, and applies to any wave-based network including quantum networks."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08493": {"title": "Rumor Forwarding Prediction Model Based on Uncertain Time Series", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08493", "description": "arXiv:2403.08493v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: The rapid spread of rumors in social media is mainly caused by individual retweets.

Here, we investigate the evolution of cooperation in a two-agent system, where each agent pursues optimal policies according to the classical Q-learning algorithm in playing the strict prisoner's dilemma. We reveal that a strong memory and long-sighted expectation yield the emergence of Coordinated Optimal Policies (COPs), where both agents act like Win-Stay, Lose-Shift (WSLS) to maintain a high level of cooperation. Otherwise, players become tolerant toward their co-player's defection and the cooperation loses stability in the end where the policy all Defection (All-D) prevails. This suggests that tolerance could be a good precursor to a crisis in cooperation. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the Coordinated Optimal Modes (COMs) for different COPs gradually lose stability as memory weakens and expectation for the future decreases, where agents fail to predict co-player's action in games and defection dominates. As a result, we give the constraint to expectations of future and memory strength for maintaining cooperation.

Moreover, both of the paradigms neglect the explicit user-item interactions from both domains during the mapping process. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a novel CDR framework with neural process (NP), termed as CDRNP. Particularly, it develops the meta-learning paradigm to leverage user-specific preference, and further introduces a stochastic process by NP to capture the preference correlations among the overlapping and cold-start users, thus generating more powerful mapping functions by mapping the user-specific preference and common preference correlations to a predictive probability distribution. In addition, we also introduce a preference remainer to enhance the common preference from the overlapping users, and finally devises an adaptive conditional decoder with preference modulation to make prediction for cold-start users with items in the target domain. Experimental results demonstrate that CDRNP outperforms previous SOTA methods in three real-world CDR scenarios."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10322": {"title": "Exploring the Independent Cascade Model and Its Evolution in Social Network Information Diffusion", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10322", "description": "arXiv:2405.10322v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This paper delves into the paramount significance of information dissemination within the dynamic realm of social networks.

This formalism requires a large number of heterogeneous agents, possibly of different types. It reveals the emergence of collective states among these agents or type of agents while preserving the interactions and microeconomic features of the system at the individual level. In two prior papers, we applied this formalism to analyze the dynamics of capital allocation and accumulation in a simple microeconomic framework of investors and firms.Building upon our prior work, the present paper refines the initial model by expanding its scope. Instead of considering financial firms investing solely in real sectors, we now suppose that financial agents may also invest in other financial firms. We also introduce banks in the system that act as investors with a credit multiplier. Two types of interaction are now considered within the financial sector: financial agents can lend capital to, or choose to buy shares of, other financial firms. Capital now flows between financial agents and is only partly invested in real sectors, depending on their relative returns. We translate this framework into our formalism and study the diffusion of capital and possible defaults in the system, both at the macro and micro level.At the macro level, we find that several collective states may emerge, each characterized by a distinct level of average capital and investors per sector. These collective states depend on external parameters such as level of connections between investors or firms' productivity.The multiplicity of possible collective states is the consequence of the nature of the system composed of interconnected heterogeneous agents. Several equivalent patterns of returns and portfolio allocation may emerge. The multiple collective states induce the unstable nature of financial markets, and some of them include defaults may emerge. At the micro level, we study the propagation of returns and defaults within a given collective state. Our findings highlight the significant role of banks, which can either stabilize the system through lending activities or propagate instability through loans to investors."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10355": {"title": "Assessing the Impact of Case Correction Methods on the Fairness of COVID-19 Predictive Models", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10355", "description": "arXiv:2405.10355v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: One of the central difficulties of addressing the COVID-19 pandemic has been accurately measuring and predicting the spread of infections. In particular, official COVID-19 case counts in the United States are under counts of actual caseloads due to the absence of universal testing policies. Researchers have proposed a variety of methods for recovering true caseloads, often through the estimation of statistical models on more reliable measures, such as death and hospitalization counts, positivity rates, and demographics. However, given the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on marginalized racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups, it is important to consider potential unintended effects of case correction methods on these groups. Thus, we investigate two of these correction methods for their impact on a downstream COVID-19 case prediction task. For that purpose, we tailor an auditing approach and evaluation protocol to analyze the fairness of the COVID-19 prediction task by measuring the difference in model performance between majority-White counties and majority-minority counties. We find that one of the correction methods improves fairness, decreasing differences in performance between majority-White and majority-minority counties, while the other method increases differences, introducing bias. While these results are mixed, it is evident that correction methods have the potential to exacerbate existing biases in COVID-19 case data and in downstream prediction tasks.

While heating flexibility could reduce the impact of additional demand from heat pumps on the power system, characterizing the national spatial distribution of heating flexibility capacity to incorporate into sophisticated power system models is challenging. This paper introduces a novel method for quantifying at large scale and high spatial resolution the energy capacity and duration of heating flexibility in existing building stock based on historical heating consumption and temperature data. This method can reflect the geographic diversity of the national building stock in sophisticated power system models. The proposed heating consumption-based method was tested in Britain using national residential gas data. The results demonstrate the potential of this approach to characterize the heterogeneous distribution of heating flexibility capacity at the national scale. Assuming a 3$^\\circ$C temperature flexibility window, a total thermal energy storage capacity of 500 GWh$_{th}$ is identified in the British housing stock. For an illustrative cold weather COP value of 2.5, this thermal energy storage capacity is equivalent to 200 GWh of electricity storage. Regarding heating flexibility duration, gas-heated homes have a median of 5.9 heat-free hours for 20th percentile regional daily winter temperatures from 2010 to 2022. However, extreme cold days nearly halve flexibility duration to a median of 3.6 heat-free hours.

In most other settings, aggregating the impressions of multiple agents leads to better performance than delegation.

Partitioning the target node set in such graphs into k disjoint clusters (referred to as k-ABGC) finds widespread use in various domains, including social network analysis, recommendation systems, information retrieval, and bioinformatics. However, the majority of existing solutions towards k-ABGC either overlook attribute information or fail to capture bipartite graph structures accurately, engendering severely compromised result quality. The severity of these issues is accentuated in real ABGs, which often encompass millions of nodes and a sheer volume of attribute data, rendering effective k-ABGC over such graphs highly challenging.\n  In this paper, we propose TPO, an effective and efficient approach to k-ABGC that achieves superb clustering performance on multiple real datasets. TPO obtains high clustering quality through two major contributions: (i) a novel formulation and transformation of the k-ABGC problem based on multi-scale attribute affinity specialized for capturing attribute affinities between nodes with the consideration of their multi-hop connections in ABGs, and (ii) a highly efficient solver that includes a suite of carefully-crafted optimizations for sidestepping explicit affinity matrix construction and facilitating faster convergence. Extensive experiments, comparing TPO against 19 baselines over 5 real ABGs, showcase the superior clustering quality of TPO measured against ground-truth labels.

We conceptualized this problem as an agent migration process on a multilayer transportation network, in which each layer represented a different transportation mode. As no direct data were available about people's behaviors on campus, we collected as much indirect information as possible to inform the agents' behavioral rules. Each agent was assumed to move along the shortest path between two locations within each transportation layer and switch layers at a parking lot or a bus stop, along with several other behavioral assumptions. Using this model, we conducted simulations of the whole campus population behaviors on a typical weekday, involving more than 25,000 agents. We measured the frequency of close social contacts at each spatial location and identified several busy locations and corridors on campus that needed substantial behavioral intervention.

When only the diffusion traces (cascades) are accessible, cascade-based network inference and influence estimation are two essential problems to explore. Alas, existing methods exhibit limited capability to infer and process networks with more than a few thousand nodes, suffering from scalability issues. In this paper, we view the diffusion process as a continuous-time dynamical system, based on which we establish a continuous-time diffusion model. Subsequently, we instantiate the model to a scalable and effective framework (FIM) to approximate the diffusion propagation from available cascades, thereby inferring the underlying network structure. Furthermore, we undertake an analysis of the approximation error of FIM for network inference. To achieve the desired scalability for influence estimation, we devise an advanced sampling technique and significantly boost the efficiency. We also quantify the effect of the approximation error on influence estimation theoretically. Experimental results showcase the effectiveness and superior scalability of FIM on network inference and influence estimation."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13094": {"title": "KPG: Key Propagation Graph Generator for Rumor Detection based on Reinforcement Learning", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13094", "description": "arXiv:2405.13094v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The proliferation of rumors on social media platforms during significant events, such as the US elections and the COVID-19 pandemic, has a profound impact on social stability and public health. Existing approaches for rumor detection primarily rely on propagation graphs to enhance model effectiveness. However, the presence of noisy and irrelevant structures during the propagation process limits the efficacy of these approaches. To tackle this issue, techniques such as weight adjustment and data augmentation have been proposed. However, these techniques heavily depend on rich original propagation structures, thus hindering performance when dealing with rumors that lack sufficient propagation information in the early propagation stages. In this paper, we propose Key Propagation Graph Generator (KPG), a novel reinforcement learning-based rumor detection framework that generates contextually coherent and informative propagation patterns for events with insufficient topology information, while also identifies indicative substructures for events with redundant and noisy propagation structures. KPG consists of two key components: the Candidate Response Generator (CRG) and the Ending Node Selector (ENS). CRG learns the latent distribution from refined propagation patterns, filtering out noise and generating new candidates for ENS. Simultaneously, ENS identifies the most influential substructures within propagation graphs and generates training data for CRG. Moreover, we introduce an end-to-end framework that utilizes rewards to guide the entire training process via a pre-trained graph neural network. Extensive experiments conducted on four datasets demonstrate the superiority of our KPG compared to the state-of-the-art approaches."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13224": {"title": "Integrating behavioral experimental findings into dynamical models to inform social change interventions", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13224", "description": "arXiv:2405.13224v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Addressing global challenges -- from public health to climate change -- often involves stimulating the large-scale adoption of new products or behaviors. Research traditions that focus on individual decision making suggest that achieving this objective requires better identifying the drivers of individual adoption choices. On the other hand, computational approaches rooted in complexity science focus on maximizing the propagation of a given product or behavior throughout social networks of interconnected adopters. The integration of these two perspectives -- although advocated by several research communities -- has remained elusive so far. Here we show how achieving this integration could inform seeding policies to facilitate the large-scale adoption of a given behavior or product. Drawing on complex contagion and discrete choice theories, we propose a method to estimate individual-level thresholds to adoption, and validate its predictive power in two choice experiments. By integrating the estimated thresholds into computational simulations, we show that state-of-the-art seeding methods for social influence maximization might be suboptimal if they neglect individual-level behavioral drivers, which can be corrected through the proposed experimental method."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13480": {"title": "What is a typical signalized intersection in a city?

Several studies have been conducted focusing on intersection-level control and optimization. However, arbitrarily structured signalized intersections that are often used do not represent the ground-truth distribution, and there is no standardized way that exists to extract information about real-world signalized intersections.

For instance, graph representation learning learns a d-dimensional embedding space, so that the nodes that tend to co-occur on random walks (a proxy of being in the same network neighborhood) are close in the embedding space. Specific local network topology (i.e., structure) influences the co-occurrence of nodes on random walks, so random walks of limited length capture only partial topological information, hence diminishing the performance of downstream methods. We explicitly capture all topological neighborhood information and improve performance by introducing orbit adjacencies that quantify the adjacencies of two nodes as co-occurring on a given pair of graphlet orbits, which are symmetric positions on graphlets (small, connected, non-isomorphic, induced subgraphs of a large network). Importantly, we mathematically prove that random walks on up to k nodes capture only a subset of all the possible orbit adjacencies for up to k-node graphlets. Furthermore, we enable orbit adjacency-based analysis of networks by developing an efficient GRaphlet-orbit ADjacency COunter (GRADCO), which exhaustively computes all 28 orbit adjacency matrices for up to four-node graphlets.

Based on a dataset compiling millions of real estate transactions over the period 2017-2021, we investigate the regularities of the radial (center-periphery) profiles of housing prices across cities, with respect to their size. Results are threefold. First, they corroborate prior findings in the urban scaling literature stating that largest cities agglomerate higher housing prices. Second, we find that housing price radial profiles scale in three dimensions with the power 1/5 of city population. After rescaling, great regularities between radial profiles can be observed, although some locational amenities have a significant impact on prices. Third, it appears that our rescaled profiles approach fails to explain housing price variations in the city center across cities. In fact, prices near the city center rise much faster with city size than those in the periphery. This has strong implications for low-income households seeking homeownership, because prohibitive prices in the center may contribute to pushing them out into peripheral locations."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14543": {"title": "Initial Burst of Disruptive Efforts over Individual Scientific Careers", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14543", "description": "arXiv:2405.14543v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Despite persistent efforts to understand the dynamics of creativity of scientists over careers in terms of productivity, impact, and prize, little is known about the dynamics of scientists' disruptive efforts that affect individual academic careers and drive scientific advance. Drawing on millions of data over six decades and across nineteen disciplines, associating the publication records of individual scientists with the disruption index, we systematically quantify the temporal pattern of disruptive ideas over individual scientific careers, providing a detailed understanding of the macro phenomenon of scientific stagnation from the individual perspective. We start by checking the relationship between disruption-based and citation-based publication profiles. Next, we observe the finite inequality in the disruptive productivity of scientists, diminishing gradually as the level of disruption increases. We then identify the initial burst phenomenon in disruption dynamics. It is further revealed that while early engagement in high disruption frictions away initial productivity, compared to initial advantage in productivity or impact, initial high disruption ensures more subsequent academic viability evidenced by a longer career span and relatively final higher productivity, but does not necessarily guarantee academic success throughout careers. Further analysis shows that increasing disruptive work is uncorrelated to overall productivity but negatively correlated with the overall impact. However, increasing disruptive work in the early career is associated with higher overall productivity, yet lower overall productivity in the later career. Our research underscores the urgent need for a policy shift that encourages a balance between the pursuit of disruptive efforts and the achievement of impactful outcomes."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14717": {"title": "The impact of temporal hydrogen regulation on hydrogen exporters and their domestic energy transition", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14717", "description": "arXiv:2405.14717v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: As global demand for green hydrogen rises, potential hydrogen exporters move into the spotlight.

In many cases, news embedding methods rely on full-textual information and neglect the importance of time-relevant embedding generation.

We suggest a method composed of three stages. First, we process and extract the events, entities, and themes for the given news articles. Second, we generate periodic time embeddings for themes and entities by training timely separated GloVe models on current and historical data.

Despite the success, existing spectral GNNs usually fail to deal with complex networks (e.g., WWW) due to such homogeneous spectral filtering setting that ignores the regional heterogeneity as typically seen in real-world networks. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel diverse spectral filtering (DSF) framework, which automatically learns node-specific filter weights to exploit the varying local structure properly. Particularly, the diverse filter weights consist of two components -- A global one shared among all nodes, and a local one that varies along network edges to reflect node difference arising from distinct graph parts -- to balance between local and global information. As such, not only can the global graph characteristics be captured, but also the diverse local patterns can be mined with awareness of different node positions. Interestingly, we formulate a novel optimization problem to assist in learning diverse filters, which also enables us to enhance any spectral GNNs with our DSF framework. We showcase the proposed framework on three state-of-the-arts including GPR-GNN, BernNet, and JacobiConv.

A clique is a pair $(C,[t_0,t_1])$, where $C$ is a set of vertices that all interact pairwise during the full interval $[t_0,t_1]$. It is maximal when neither its set of vertices nor its time interval can be increased. Some of the main works solving this problem are based on the famous Bron-Kerbosch algorithm for enumerating maximal cliques in graphs. We take this idea as a starting point to propose a new algorithm which matches the cliques of the instantaneous graphs formed by links existing at a given time $t$ to the maximal cliques of the link stream. We prove its validity and compute its complexity, which is better than the state-of-the art ones in many cases of interest.

Effectively harnessing event sequence data within social networks to unearth interactions among users or groups has persistently posed a challenging frontier within the realm of point processes. Current deep point process models face inherent limitations within the context of social networks, constraining both their interpretability and expressive power. These models encounter challenges in capturing interactions among users or groups and often rely on parameterized extrapolation methods when modelling intensity over non-event intervals, limiting their capacity to capture intricate intensity patterns, particularly beyond observed events. To address these challenges, this study proposes modifications to Transformer Hawkes processes (THP), leading to the development of interpretable Transformer Hawkes processes (ITHP). ITHP inherits the strengths of THP while aligning with statistical nonlinear Hawkes processes, thereby enhancing its interpretability and providing valuable insights into interactions between users or groups. Additionally, ITHP enhances the flexibility of the intensity function over non-event intervals, making it better suited to capture complex event propagation patterns in social networks. Experimental results, both on synthetic and real data, demonstrate the effectiveness of ITHP in overcoming the identified limitations.

This inadequacy is particularly evident in link prediction tasks that require a comprehensive understanding of graph topology and semantics between nodes. In this paper, we present a novel framework - Link2Doc, designed especially for link prediction on textual-edge graphs. Specifically, we propose to summarize neighborhood information between node pairs as a human-written document to preserve both semantic and topology information. A self-supervised learning model is then utilized to enhance GNN's text-understanding ability from language models. Empirical evaluations, including link prediction, edge classification, parameter analysis, runtime comparison, and ablation studies, on four real-world datasets demonstrate that Link2Doc achieves generally better performance against existing edge-aware GNNs and pre-trained language models in predicting links on TEGs."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16772": {"title": "Balancing User Preferences by Social Networks: A Condition-Guided Social Recommendation Model for Mitigating Popularity Bias", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16772", "description": "arXiv:2405.16772v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Social recommendation models weave social interactions into their design to provide uniquely personalized recommendation results for users. However, social networks not only amplify the popularity bias in recommendation models, resulting in more frequent recommendation of hot items and fewer long-tail items, but also include a substantial amount of redundant information that is essentially meaningless for the model's performance. Existing social recommendation models fail to address the issues of popularity bias and the redundancy of social information, as they directly characterize social influence across the entire social network without making targeted adjustments. In this paper, we propose a Condition-Guided Social Recommendation Model (named CGSoRec) to mitigate the model's popularity bias by denoising the social network and adjusting the weights of user's social preferences. More specifically, CGSoRec first includes a Condition-Guided Social Denoising Model (CSD) to remove redundant social relations in the social network for capturing users' social preferences with items more precisely. Then, CGSoRec calculates users' social preferences based on denoised social network and adjusts the weights in users' social preferences to make them can counteract the popularity bias present in the recommendation model. At last, CGSoRec includes a Condition-Guided Diffusion Recommendation Model (CGD) to introduce the adjusted social preferences as conditions to control the recommendation results for a debiased direction.

This \"rebound\" phenomenon challenges the conventional understanding of vaccination impacts on epidemic dynamics. We provide a detailed examination of how improperly timed vaccination efforts can inadvertently reduce the overall immunity level in a population, considering both natural and vaccine-induced immunity. Our findings reveal that such a decrease in population-wide immunity can lead to a delayed, yet more severe, resurgence of cases. This study not only adds a critical dimension to our understanding of vaccination strategies in controlling pandemics but also underscores the necessity for strategically timed interventions to optimize public health outcomes. Furthermore, we compute which vaccination strategies are optimal for a COVID-19 tailored mathematical model, and find that there are two types of optimal strategies. The first type prioritizes vaccinating early and rapidly to reduce the number of deaths, while the second type acts later and more slowly to reduce the number of cases; both of them target primarily the elderly population.

Such limitation motivates us to pose the problem of the time-aware personalized information diffusion prediction for the first time, telling the time when the target user will be informed. In this paper, we address this problem from a fresh geometric perspective of Ricci curvature, and propose a novel Ricci-curvature regulated Ordinary Differential Equation (R-ODE). In the diffusion process, R-ODE considers that the inter-correlated users are organized in a dynamic system in the representation space, and the cascades give the observations sampled from the continuous realm. At each infection time, the message diffuses along the largest Ricci curvature, signifying less transportation effort. In the continuous realm, the message triggers users' movement, whose trajectory in the space is parameterized by an ODE with graph neural network. Consequently, R-ODE predicts the infection time of a target user by the movement trajectory learnt from the observations.

The accessibility of these communities allows users to join multiple types of hate groups (e.g., a racist community and misogynistic community), which calls into question whether these peripatetic users could be further radicalized compared to users that stay in one type of hate group. However, little is known about the dynamics of joining multiple types of hate groups, nor the effect of these groups on peripatetic users. In this paper, we develop a new method to classify hate subreddits, and the identities they disparage, which we use to better understand how users become peripatetic (join different types of hate subreddits). The hate classification technique utilizes human-validated LLMs to extract the protected identities attacked, if any, across 168 subreddits. We then cluster identity-attacking subreddits to discover three broad categories of hate: racist, anti-LGBTQ, and misogynistic. We show that becoming active in a user's first hate subreddit can cause them to become active in additional hate subreddits of a different category. We also find that users who join additional hate subreddits, especially of a different category, become more active in hate subreddits as a whole and develop a wider hate group lexicon. We are therefore motivated to train an AI model that we find usefully predicts the hate categories users will become active in based on post text read and written. The accuracy of this model may be partly driven by peripatetic users often using the language of hate subreddits they eventually join. Overall, these results highlight the unique risks associated with hate communities on a social media platform, as discussion of alternative targets of hate may lead users to target more protected identities."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16346": {"title": "A modular and scalable web platform for computational phylogenetics", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16346", "description": "arXiv:2405.16346v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Phylogenetic analysis, which allow to understand the evolution of bacterial and viral epidemics, requires large quantities of data to be analysed and processed for knowledge extraction.

Unfortunately, due to exposure bias and users' different willingness to comment, it is not easy to obtain diverse comments in reality, especially for early detection scenarios. Without obtaining the comments from the ``silent'' users, the perceived opinions may be incomplete, subsequently affecting news veracity judgment. In this paper, we explore the possibility of finding an alternative source of comments to guarantee the availability of diverse comments, especially those from silent users. Specifically, we propose to adopt large language models (LLMs) as a user simulator and comment generator, and design GenFEND, a generated feedback-enhanced detection framework, which generates comments by prompting LLMs with diverse user profiles and aggregating generated comments from multiple subpopulation groups.

Existing works obtain the evolving patterns mainly depending on the most recent neighbor sequences. However, we argue that whether two nodes will have interaction with each other in the future is highly correlated with the same interaction that happened in the past. Only considering the recent neighbors overlooks the phenomenon of repeat behavior and fails to accurately capture the temporal evolution of interactions. To fill this gap, this paper presents RepeatMixer, which considers evolving patterns of first and high-order repeat behavior in the neighbor sampling strategy and temporal information learning. Firstly, we define the first-order repeat-aware nodes of the source node as the destination nodes that have interacted historically and extend this concept to high orders as nodes in the destination node's high-order neighbors. Then, we extract neighbors of the source node that interacted before the appearance of repeat-aware nodes with a slide window strategy as its neighbor sequence. Next, we leverage both the first and high-order neighbor sequences of source and destination nodes to learn temporal patterns of interactions via an MLP-based encoder. Furthermore, considering the varying temporal patterns on different orders, we introduce a time-aware aggregation mechanism that adaptively aggregates the temporal representations from different orders based on the significance of their interaction time sequences.

However, in many real-world graphs, connected nodes may display contrasting behaviors, termed as heterophilous patterns, which has attracted increased interest in heterophilous GNNs (HTGNNs). Although the message-passing mechanism seems unsuitable for heterophilous graphs due to the propagation of class-irrelevant information, it is still widely used in many existing HTGNNs and consistently achieves notable success. This raises the question: why does message passing remain effective on heterophilous graphs? To answer this question, in this paper, we revisit the message-passing mechanisms in heterophilous graph neural networks and reformulate them into a unified heterophilious message-passing (HTMP) mechanism. Based on HTMP and empirical analysis, we reveal that the success of message passing in existing HTGNNs is attributed to implicitly enhancing the compatibility matrix among classes. Moreover, we argue that the full potential of the compatibility matrix is not completely achieved due to the existence of incomplete and noisy semantic neighborhoods in real-world heterophilous graphs. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new approach named CMGNN, which operates within the HTMP mechanism to explicitly leverage and improve the compatibility matrix.

Boyd, Gintis, Bowles, and Richerson have used simulation models of cultural evolution to suggest that altruistic punishment and pairwise group-level competition can work in concert to promote cooperation, even when neither mechanism can do so on its own. In this paper, we formulate a PDE model for multilevel selection motivated by the approach of Boyd and coauthors, modeling individual-level birth-death competition with a replicator equation based on individual payoffs and describing group-level competition with pairwise conflicts based on differences in the average payoffs of the competing groups. Building off of existing PDE models for multilevel selection with frequency-independent group-level competition, we use analytical and numerical techniques to understand how the forms of individual and average payoffs can impact the long-time ability to sustain altruistic punishment in group-structured populations. We find several interesting differences between the behavior of our new PDE model with pairwise group-level competition and existing multilevel PDE models, including the observation that our new model can feature a non-monotonic dependence of the long-time collective payoff on the strength of altruistic punishment.

Fortunately, machine learning provides a new avenue for addressing this challenge. However, several key issues remain unresolved, including the performance in more general edge removal scenarios, capturing robustness through attack curves instead of directly training for robustness, scalability of predictive tasks, and transferability of predictive capabilities. In this paper, we address these challenges by designing a convolutional neural networks (CNN) model with spatial pyramid pooling networks (SPP-net), adapting existing evaluation metrics, redesigning the attack modes, introducing appropriate filtering rules, and incorporating the value of robustness as training data. The results demonstrate the thoroughness of the proposed CNN framework in addressing the challenges of high computational time across various network types, failure component types and failure scenarios. However, the performance of the proposed CNN model varies: for evaluation tasks that are consistent with the trained network type, the proposed CNN model consistently achieves accurate evaluations of both attack curves and robustness values across all removal scenarios. When the predicted network type differs from the trained network, the CNN model still demonstrates favorable performance in the scenario of random node failure, showcasing its scalability and performance transferability. Nevertheless, the performance falls short of expectations in other removal scenarios.

The definition of core-periphery structure in multiplex networks that record different types of interactions between the same set of nodes on different layers is nontrivial since a node may belong to the core in some layers and to the periphery in others. We propose a nonlinear spectral method for multiplex networks that simultaneously optimises a node and a layer coreness vector by maximising a suitable nonconvex homogeneous objective function by a provably convergent alternating fixed point iteration. We derive a quantitative measure for the quality of a given multiplex core-periphery structure that allows the determination of the optimal core size. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world networks illustrate that our approach is robust against noisy layers and significantly outperforms baseline methods while improving the latter with our novel optimised layer coreness weights.

The intricate pattern of interactions often allows the system to achieve complex tasks, such as synchronization or collective motions. In this regard, the interplay between network structure and dynamics has long been recognized as a cornerstone of network science. Among dynamical processes, random walks are undoubtedly among the most studied stochastic processes. While traditionally, the random walkers are assumed to be independent, this assumption breaks down if nodes are endowed with a finite carrying capacity, a feature shared by many real-life systems. Recently, a class of nonlinear diffusion processes accounting for the finite carrying capacities of the nodes was introduced. The stationary nodes densities were shown to be nonlinearly correlated with the nodes degrees, allowing to uncover the network structure by performing a few measurements of the stationary density at the level of a single arbitrary node and by solving an inverse problem. In this work, we extend this class of nonlinear diffusion processes to the case of multigraphs, in which links between nodes carry distinct attributes.

The analysis uses a model intercomparison with a range of energy-economy models using harmonized policy scenarios reaching economy-wide, net-zero CO2 emissions across the United States in 2050. We employ a novel linking approach that connects output from detailed energy system models with survey microdata on energy expenditures across income classes to provide distributional analysis of net-zero policies. Although there are differences in model structure and input assumptions, we find broad agreement in qualitative trends in policy incidence and energy burdens across income groups. Models generally agree that direct energy expenditures for many households will likely decline over time with reference and net-zero policies. However, there is variation in the extent of changes relative to current levels, energy burdens relative to reference levels, and electricity expenditures. Policy design, primarily how climate policy revenues are used, has first-order impacts on distributional outcomes. Net-zero policy costs, in both absolute and relative terms, are unevenly distributed across households, and relative increases in energy expenditures are higher for lowest-income households.

Here, we report on two key roles that nodes can play in the progression towards noise-induced tipping points. The models used are dynamical networks where the nodes are governed by the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution, but the concept is easily generalized. First, so-called `initiator nodes' absorb and then transmit short-lived fluctuations to neighboring nodes, making them temporarily more dynamic. These neighbor nodes can then in turn transmit fluctuations to their neighbors, and so on, leading to a domino-effect where the more stable a node is (i.e., high average free energy barrier), the more neighbors are needed that have become temporarily dynamic. Interestingly, towards the tipping point we identify so-called `stabilizer nodes' whose state information becomes part of the long-term memory of the system, after which the domino-effect is reversed and settles the node in their new stable attractor. We validate these roles by targeted interventions that make tipping points more (or less) likely to begin or lead to systemic change.

Most existing methods for heterogeneous graphs mainly learn node embeddings by stacking multiple convolutional or attentional layers, which can be considered as capturing the high-order information from node-level aspect. However, different types of nodes in heterogeneous graphs have diverse features, it is also necessary to capture interactions among node features, namely the high-order information from feature-level aspect. In addition, most methods first align node features by mapping them into one same low-dimensional space, while they may lose some type information of nodes in this way. To address these problems, in this paper, we propose a novel Heterogeneous graph Cascade Attention Network (HetCAN) composed of multiple cascade blocks. Each cascade block includes two components, the type-aware encoder and the dimension-aware encoder. Specifically, the type-aware encoder compensates for the loss of node type information and aims to make full use of graph heterogeneity. The dimension-aware encoder is able to learn the feature-level high-order information by capturing the interactions among node features.

We classified the articles into 20 thematic axes and obtained a set of 120 time series that capture daily newspaper attention on different topics in different provinces. To analyze the data we use a point process approach. For each topic, $n$, and for all pairs of provinces, $i$ and $j$, we use two measures to quantify the synchronicity of the events, $Q_s(i,j)$, which quantifies the number of events that occur almost simultaneously in $i$ and $j$, and $Q_a(i,j)$, which quantifies the direction of news spreading.

Our analysis unveils how fast the information diffusion process is, as high values of $Q_{s}$, $CC$, and $MI$ reveal pairs of provinces with very similar and almost simultaneous temporal variations of media attention. On the other hand, $GC$ and $TE$ do not perform well in this context because they often return opposite directions of information transfer.

Here, we consider the evolutionary dynamics of always cooperate (AllC), extortionate ZD (extortioners), and unbending players in lattice populations based on the commonly used death-birth updating. Out of the class of unbending strategies, we consider a particular candidate, PSO Gambler, a machine-learning-optimized memory-one strategy, which can foster reciprocal cooperation and fairness among extortionate players. We derive analytical results under weak selection and rare mutations, including pairwise fixation probabilities and long-term frequencies of strategies. In the absence of the third unbending type, extortioners can achieve a half-half split in equilibrium with unconditional cooperators for sufficiently large extortion factors. However, the presence of unbending players fundamentally changes the dynamics and tilts the system to favor unbending cooperation. Most surprisingly, extortioners cannot dominate at all regardless of how large their extortion factor is, and the long-term frequency of unbending players is maintained almost as a constant.

For achieving this, data assimilation using a stochastic CA model and DFOS is promising. Data assimilation with a CA enables us to model real-time traffic flow with simple processes even when rare or sudden events occur, which is challenging for usual machine learning-based methods. DFOS overcomes issues of conventional point sensors that have dead zones of observation. By estimating optimal model parameters that reproduce observed traffic flow in the simulation, future traffic flow is forecasted from the simulation.

The proposed methods are verified by simulation-based traffic flow. The simulation adopts the stochastic Nishinari-Fukui-Schadschneider model. The optimal model parameters are successfully derived from posterior probability distributions (PPDs) estimated from DFOS data. In contrast, those estimated from point sensors fail.

An important task in studying large datasets with graphical structure is graph clustering. While there has been a lot of work on graph clustering using the connectivity between the nodes, many real-world networks also have node attributes. Clustering attributed graphs requires joint modeling of graph structure and node attributes. Recent work has focused on combining these two complementary sources of information through graph convolutional networks and graph filtering. However, these methods are mostly limited to lowpass filtering and do not explicitly learn the filter parameters for the clustering task. In this paper, we introduce a graph signal processing based approach, where we learn the parameters of Finite Impulse Response (FIR) and Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) graph filters optimized for clustering. The proposed approach is formulated as a two-step iterative optimization problem, focusing on learning interpretable graph filters that are optimal for the given data and that maximize the separation between different clusters.

Despite the notable success, there is very limited literature that provides a theoretical tool for characterizing the behaviors of long-tail classes in graphs and gaining insight into generalization performance in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose a generalization bound for long-tail classification on graphs by formulating the problem in the fashion of multi-task learning, i.e., each task corresponds to the prediction of one particular class. Our theoretical results show that the generalization performance of long-tail classification is dominated by the overall loss range and the task complexity. Building upon the theoretical findings, we propose a novel generic framework HierTail for long-tail classification on graphs. In particular, we start with a hierarchical task grouping module that allows us to assign related tasks into hypertasks and thus control the complexity of the task space; then, we further design a balanced contrastive learning module to adaptively balance the gradients of both head and tail classes to control the loss range across all tasks in a unified fashion.

The state-of-the-art algorithms all adopt the branch-reduction-and-bound (BRB) framework where a key step, called reduction-and-bound (RB), is used for narrowing down the search space. A common practice of RB in existing works is SeqRB, which sequentially conducts the reduction process followed by the bounding process once at a branch.

AltRB first partitions a branch into two parts and then alternatively and iteratively conducts the reduction process and the bounding process at each part of a branch. With newly-designed reduction rules and bounding methods, AltRB is superior to SeqRB in effectively narrowing down the search space in both theory and practice.

In these applications, complete diffusion histories play an essential role in terms of identifying dynamical patterns, reflecting on precaution actions, and forecasting intervention effects. Despite their importance, complete diffusion histories are rarely available and are highly challenging to reconstruct due to ill-posedness, explosive search space, and scarcity of training data. To date, few methods exist for diffusion history reconstruction. They are exclusively based on the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) formulation and require to know true diffusion parameters. In this paper, we study an even harder problem, namely reconstructing Diffusion history from A single SnapsHot} (DASH), where we seek to reconstruct the history from only the final snapshot without knowing true diffusion parameters. We start with theoretical analyses that reveal a fundamental limitation of the MLE formulation. We prove: (a) estimation error of diffusion parameters is unavoidable due to NP-hardness of diffusion parameter estimation, and (b) the MLE formulation is sensitive to estimation error of diffusion parameters. To overcome the inherent limitation of the MLE formulation, we propose a novel barycenter formulation: finding the barycenter of the posterior distribution of histories, which is provably stable against the estimation error of diffusion parameters.

The availability of those labelled training data provides crucial prior knowledge about abnormalities for GAD models, enabling substantially reduced detection errors. However, current methods tend to over-emphasise fitting the seen anomalies, leading to a weak generalisation ability to detect the unseen anomalies.

In this work, we propose a novel open-set GAD approach, namely Normal Structure Regularisation (NSReg) to achieve generalised detection ability to unseen anomalies, while maintaining its effectiveness on detecting seen anomalies. The key idea in NSReg is to introduce a regularisation term that enforces the learning of compact, semantically-rich representations of normal nodes based on their structural relations to other nodes. When being optimised with supervised anomaly detection losses, the regularisation term helps incorporate strong normality into the modelling, and thus, it effectively avoids the overfitting the seen anomalies solely.

This study is made possible through the design and implementation of multiple novel tools for detecting and analyzing illicit promotion activities as well as their underlying campaigns. As the results, we observe that illicit promotion is prevalent on Twitter, along with noticeable existence on other three popular OSNs including Youtube, Facebook, and TikTok. Particularly, 12 million distinct posts of illicit promotion (PIPs) have been observed on the Twitter platform, which are widely distributed in 5 major natural languages and 10 categories of illicit goods and services, e.g., drugs, data leakage, gambling, and weapon sales. What are also observed are 580K Twitter accounts publishing PIPs as well as 37K distinct instant messaging (IM) accounts that are embedded in PIPs and serve as next hops of communication, which strongly indicates that the campaigns underpinning PIPs are also of a large scale. Also, an arms race between Twitter and illicit promotion operators is also observed. On one hand, Twitter is observed to conduct content moderation in a continuous manner and almost 80% PIPs will get gradually unpublished within six months since posted.

The proposed concept of the graph structural complexity corresponds to qualitative comprehension of the complexity. The proposed measure can be obtained for the weighted graphs also. The structural complexities for various graph types were found - the deterministic infinite and finite size graphs, artificial graphs of different natures including percolation structures, and the time series of cardiac rhythms mapped to complex networks using the parametric visibility graph algorithm. The latter reaches a maximum near the formation of a giant component in the graph or at the percolation threshold for 2D and 3D square lattices when a giant cluster having a fractal structure has emerged. Therefore, the graph structural complexity allows us to detect and study the processes similar to a second-order phase transition in complex networks. A new node centrality index, characterizing the structural complexity of a certain node within the graph structure is introduced also, it can serve as a good auxiliary or generalization to the local clustering coefficient.

This means that users connected by social ties tend to have similar tastes in user-item activities, such as rating and purchasing.

Given the rapid progress of this research direction, a systematic review summarizing the latest advancements for Graph ML in the era of LLMs is necessary to provide an in-depth understanding to researchers and practitioners. Therefore, in this survey, we first review the recent developments in Graph ML. We then explore how LLMs can be utilized to enhance the quality of graph features, alleviate the reliance on labeled data, and address challenges such as graph heterogeneity and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Afterward, we delve into how graphs can enhance LLMs, highlighting their abilities to enhance LLM pre-training and inference.

However, higher-level factors such as the nature of the online item and the credibility of its source also play crucial roles in determining how widely and rapidly the online item spreads.

We formulate the BMH model as a hierarchical mixture model of separable Hawkes processes, accommodating different classes of Hawkes dynamics and the influence of feature sets on these classes. We test the BMH model on two learning tasks, cold-start popularity prediction and temporal profile generalization performance, applying to two real-world retweet cascade datasets referencing articles from controversial and traditional media publishers.

We use matrix perturbation theory to analyze the epidemic matrix and define a vaccination strategy, assuming the vaccination reduces the susceptibles. When mobility and local disease dynamics have similar time scales, it is most efficient to vaccinate the whole network because the disease grows uniformly. However, if only a few vertices can be vaccinated then which ones do we choose? We answer this question, and show that it is most efficient to vaccinate along an eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of the Laplacian. We illustrate these general results on a 7 vertex graph and a realistic example of the french rail network. When mobility is slower than local disease dynamics, the epidemic grows on the vertex with largest susceptibles. The epidemic growth rate is more reduced when vaccinating a larger degree vertex; it also depends on the neighboring vertices.

Upon diagnosis, manual contact tracing is triggered such that each infected network contact is reported, tested and isolated with some probability and after a random delay. Additionally, digital tracing (based on a tracing app) is triggered if the diagnosed individual is an app-user, and then all of its app-using infectees are immediately notified and isolated. The early phase of the epidemic with manual and/or digital tracing is approximated by different multi-type branching processes, and three respective reproduction numbers are derived. The effectiveness of both contact tracing mechanisms is numerically quantified through the reduction of the reproduction number. This shows that app-using fraction plays an essential role in the overall effectiveness of contact tracing. The relative effectiveness of manual tracing compared to digital tracing increases if: more of the transmission occurs on the network, when the tracing delay is shortened, and when the network degree distribution is heavy-tailed.

While recent work has focused on designing so-called post-hoc explainers, the broader question of what constitutes a good explanation remains open. One intuitive property is that explanations should be sufficiently informative to reproduce the predictions given the data. In other words, a good explainer can be repurposed as a predictor. Post-hoc explainers do not achieve this goal as their explanations are highly dependent on fixed model parameters (e.g., learned GNN weights).

In networks with well-separated communities, the metric backbone tends to preserve many inter-community edges, because these edges serve as bridges connecting two communities, but tends to delete many intra-community edges because the communities are dense. This suggests that the metric backbone would dilute or destroy the community structure of the network. However, this is not borne out by prior empirical work, which instead showed that the metric backbone of real networks preserves the community structure of the original network well. In this work, we analyze the metric backbone of a broad class of weighted random graphs with communities, and we formally prove the robustness of the community structure with respect to the deletion of all the edges that are not in the metric backbone.

Consequently, label noise is common in real-world graph data, negatively impacting GNNs by propagating incorrect information during training.

In this study, we analyze 6 years (2016-2021) of Italian vaccine debate across diverse social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube), encompassing all major news sources - both questionable and reliable. We first use the symbolic transfer entropy analysis of news production time-series to dynamically determine which category of sources, questionable or reliable, causally drives the agenda on vaccines. Then, leveraging deep learning models capable to accurately classify vaccine-related content based on the conveyed stance and discussed topic, respectively, we evaluate the focus on various topics by news sources promoting opposing views and compare the resulting user engagement. Aside from providing valuable resources for further investigation of vaccine-related misinformation, particularly in a language (Italian) that receives less attention in scientific research compared to languages like English, our study uncovers misinformation not as a parasite of the news ecosystem that merely opposes the perspectives offered by mainstream media, but as an autonomous force capable of even overwhelming the production of vaccine-related content from the latter. While the pervasiveness of misinformation is evident in the significantly higher engagement of questionable sources compared to reliable ones, our findings underscore the importance of consistent and thorough pro-vax coverage.

We propose a spectral method based on a novel network operator whose spectral properties effectively overcome both challenges. This operator is a refined version of the non-backtracking operator, adapted from a \"centered\" adjacency matrix. Its leading eigenvalues are more concentrated than those of the adjacency matrix for sparse networks, while they also demonstrate enhanced signal under imbalance scenarios, a benefit attributed to the centering step.

Numerical simulations of the full system show both continuous (second order) as well as discontinuous transitions. The discontinuous transitions can either be associated with explosive (first order) or with tiered synchronization states depending on the choice of parameters. To develop an in depth understanding of the transition scenario in the parameter space we derive a reduced order model (ROM) using the Ott-Antonsen ansatz, the results of which closely matches with that of the numerical simulations of the full system. The simplicity and analytical accessibility of the ROM helps to conveniently unfold the transition scenario in the system having complex dependence on the parameters. Simultaneous analysis of the full system and the ROM clearly identifies the regions of the parameter space exhibiting different types of transitions.

Building on this, our current study examines how much each party contributes to collision avoidance by measuring deviations from their intended paths. Our findings suggest that individuals prioritise trajectory efficiency in undisturbed situations, but prioritise safety when encountering dyads, deviating more from their intended path. Non-interacting dyads present a similar behavior, although their trajectories appear to be even more efficient than those of individuals in undisturbed situations, and their deviations during encounters less pronounced. On the other hand, socially interacting dyads are not very efficient in undisturbed situations, and their behavior is mostly unaffected by encounters. These results strongly suggest that group dynamics affects in two ways the behavior of pedestrians, namely it has a dynamical and a social effect. The dynamical effect stabilises their trajectory, while the social one decreases the ability to focus on the external environment, leading to reduced efficiency and safety. Another finding concerns the tendency of individuals to avoid in a more prominent way the interacting dyads as compared to non-interacting ones. This suggests that individuals may assess others' contribution to collision avoidance. An impact parameter analysis reveals that collision risk influences path deviations in pedestrian encounters. For individuals, larger behavioral differences between low and high interaction levels of the dyad occur both when the collision risk is high and during less critical encounters. For dyads, the deviation differences between low and high interaction levels are most pronounced when the individual is on course to pass close to the dyad."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06200": {"title": "Inequalities of energy release rates in compression of nano-porous materials predict its imminent breakdown", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06200", "description": "arXiv:2406.06200v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We show that the divergent acoustic energy release rate in a quasi-statically compressed nano-porous material can be used as a precursor to failure in such materials.

These challenges exhibit complex behaviors, particularly when the interaction network and opinion of agents evolve simultaneously. We take homophilic networks as an example, where disproportionate interaction with like-minded neighbors leads to the emergence of echo chambers, preventing collective consensus. Our simulation results confirm that, besides a lack of exposure to attitude-challenging opinions, seeking reaffirming information entraps agents in echo chambers.

DAGs often result from contagion processes over networks, including information spreading, retweet activity, disease transmission, financial crisis propagation, malware spread, and gene mutations. For instance, in disease spreading, an infected patient can transmit the disease to contacts, making it crucial to analyze and predict scenarios. Similarly, in finance, understanding the effects of saving or not saving specific banks during a crisis is vital. Experts often need to identify small differences between DAGs, such as changes in a few nodes or edges. Even the presence or absence of a single edge can be significant. Visualization plays a crucial role in facilitating these comparisons. However, standard hierarchical layout algorithms struggle to visualize subtle changes effectively. The typical hierarchical layout, with the root on top, is preferred due to its performance in comparison to other layouts. Nevertheless, these standard algorithms prioritize single-graph aesthetics over comparison suitability, making it challenging for users to spot changes. To address this issue, we propose a layout that enhances shape changes in DAGs while minimizing the impact on aesthetics. Our approach involves outwardly swapping changes, altering the DAG's shape. We introduce new drawing criteria. Our layout builds upon a Sugiyama-like hierarchical layout and implements these criteria through two extensions. We designed it this way to maintain interchangeability and accommodate future optimizations, such as pseudo-nodes for edge crossing minimization. In our evaluations, our layout achieves excellent results, with edge crossing aesthetics averaging around 0.8 (on a scale of 0 to 1). Additionally, our layout outperforms the base implementation by an average of 60-75\\%."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05582": {"title": "On the Role of Communications for Space Domain Awareness", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05582", "description": "arXiv:2406.05582v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Space Domain Awareness (SDA) has become increasingly vital with the rapid growth of commercial space activities and the expansion of New Space.

By comparing the centralized architecture with the proposed distributed architecture, we highlight the advantages of enhanced coverage and resilience. Our findings show that on-orbit distribution greatly outperforms individual downhaul in terms of latency and scalability. Specifically, the latency results for on-orbit distribution are substantially lower and more consistent, even as the number of satellites increases. In addition, we address the inherent challenges associated with on-orbit distribution architecture, particularly cybersecurity concerns.

However, there is still insufficient evidence that they can effectively replicate the brains' real activation patterns. Moreover, it remains unclear whether actual network structures are crucial in simulating intelligence. Addressing these issues, we propose a large scale network communication model based on simple rules and design criteria to assess the differences between network models and real situations. To enhance the connection with the real world, we also incorporate an improved neuron dynamic model. We conduct research on the biggest adult Drosophila connectome data set. Experimental results show significant activation in neurons that should respond to stimulus and slight activation in irrelevant ones, which we call quasi-real activation pattern. Besides, when changing the network structure, the quasi-activation patterns disappear. Interestingly, activation regions have shorter network distances to their input neurons, implying that the network structure (not spatial distance) is the core to form brain functionality. In addition, giving input neurons a unilateral stimulus, we observe a bilateral response, which is consistent with reality. Then we find that both hemispheres have extremely similar statistical indicators. We also develop real-time 3D large spatial network visualization software to observe experimental phenomena, filling the software gap.

We complied a Misinfo Dataset that contains COVID-19 vaccine-related misinformation tweets annotated by author identities, Bots vs Humans, from Twitter during the vaccination period from July 2020 to July 2021.

It uses normative theories of free speech to examine whether and how the decentralization design could facilitate users' freedom of expression online. The analysis shows that both promises and pitfalls exist, highlighting the importance of value-based design in this area. Two most salient issues for the design of the decentralized networks are: how to balance the decentralization ideal with constant needs of centralization on the network, and how to empower users to make them truly capable of exercising their control. The article then uses some design examples, such as the shared blocklist and the opt-in search function, to illustrate the value considerations underlying the design choices. Some tentative proposals for law and policy interventions are offered to better facilitate the design of the new network. Rather than providing clear answers, the article seeks to map the value implications of the design choices, highlight the stakes, and point directions for future research."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06958": {"title": "Turning the Tide on Dark Pools?

Recent research has demonstrated the existence of ad-tech supply chain vulnerabilities such as dark pooling, where low-quality publishers bundle their ad inventory with higher-quality ones to mislead advertisers. We investigate the effectiveness of vulnerability notification campaigns aimed at mitigating dark pooling. Prior research on vulnerability notifications has primarily focused on single-stakeholder scenarios, and it is unclear whether vulnerability notifications can be effective in the multi-stakeholder ad-tech supply chain. We implement an automated vulnerability notification pipeline to systematically evaluate the responsiveness of various stakeholders, including publishers, ad-networks, and advertisers to vulnerability notifications by academics and activists. Our nine-month long multi-stakeholder notification study shows that notifications are an effective method for reducing dark pooling vulnerabilities in the online advertising ecosystem, especially when targeted towards ad-networks. Further, the sender reputation does not impact responses to notifications from activists and academics in a statistically different way.

Although none of them guessed the exact weight, the average estimate was remarkably accurate. This phenomenon is known as wisdom of crowds. In a clever experiment, Asch employed actors to demonstrate the human tendency to conform to others' opinions. The question we ask is: what would Sir Francis Galton have observed if Asch had interfered by employing actors? Would the wisdom of crowds become even wiser or not? The problem becomes intriguing when considering the inter-connectedness of the villagers, which is the central theme of this work. We examine a scenario where $n$ agents are interconnected and influence each other. The average of their opinions provides an estimator of a certain quality for some unknown quantity. How can one improve or reduce the quality of the original estimator in terms of the MSE by utilizing Asch's strategy of hiring a few stooges?\n  We present a new formulation of this problem, assuming that nodes adjust their opinions according to the Friedkin-Johnsen opinion dynamics. We demonstrate that selecting $k$ stooges for maximizing and minimizing the MSE is NP-hard. We also demonstrate that our formulation is closely related to maximizing or minimizing polarization and show NP-hardness. We propose an efficient greedy heuristic that scales to large networks and test our algorithm on synthetic and real-world datasets. Although MSE and polarization objectives differ, we find in practice that maximizing polarization often yields solutions that are nearly optimal for minimizing the wisdom of crowds in terms of MSE. Our analysis of real-world data reveals that even a small number of stooges can significantly influence the conversation on the war in Ukraine, resulting in a relative increase of the MSE of 207.80% (maximization) or a decrease of 50.62% (minimization)."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07964": {"title": "Political Leaning Inference through Plurinational Scenarios", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07964", "description": "arXiv:2406.07964v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Social media users express their political preferences via interaction with other users, by spontaneous declarations or by participation in communities within the network.

On traditional networks, they can be used to extract community structure, understand node centrality, perform link prediction, or capture the similarity between nodes. On signed networks, where the edge weights can be either positive or negative, it is non-trivial to design a random walk which can be used to extract information about the signed structure of the network, in particular the ability to partition the graph into communities with positive edges inside and negative edges in between. Prior works on signed network random walks focus on the case where there are only two such communities (strong balance), which is rarely the case in empirical networks. In this paper, we propose a signed network random walk which can capture the structure of a network with more than two such communities (weak balance). The walk results in a similarity matrix which can be used to cluster the nodes into antagonistic communities. We compare the characteristics of the so-called strong and weak random walks, in terms of walk length and stationarity. We show through a series of experiments on synthetic and empirical networks that the similarity matrix based on weak walks can be used for both unsupervised and semi-supervised clustering, outperforming the same similarity matrix based on strong walks when the graph has more than two communities, or exhibits asymmetry in the density of links.

In this paper, we explore the roles of policy actors in agenda setting by studying their relative influence in policy-related discussions. Our approach builds on ``nodality'' \\textemdash a concept in political science that determines the capacity of an actor to share information and to be at the centre of information networks. We propose a novel methodology that quantifies the nodality of all individual actors in any conversation by analysing a comprehensive set of their centrality measures in the related information network. We combine this with the analysis of the activity time-series, of the related conversation (or topic), to demonstrate how nodality scores relate to the capacity to drive topic-related activity. Here we analyse policy-related discussions on X (previously Twitter) and quantify the nodality of two sets of actors in the UK political system \\textemdash Members of Parliament (MPs) and accredited journalists - on four policy topics: The Russia-Ukraine War, the Cost-of-Living Crisis, Brexit and COVID-19. Our results show that the capacity to influence the activity related to a topic is significantly and positively associated with nodality. In particular, we identify two dimensions of nodality that drive the capacity to influence topic-related activity. The first is ``active nodality\", which reflects the level of topic-related engagement an individual actor has on the platform. The second dimension is ``inherent nodality\" which is entirely independent of the platform and reflects the actor's institutional position (such as an MP in a front-bench role, or a journalist's position at a prominent media outlet)."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12619": {"title": "Detection of Malicious Agents in Social Learning", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12619", "description": "arXiv:2403.12619v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Non-Bayesian social learning is a framework for distributed hypothesis testing aimed at learning the true state of the environment.

First, we show that even when measurement error is vanishingly small, such that the share of missed links is close to zero, forecasts about the extent of diffusion will greatly underestimate the truth. Second, a small mismeasurement in the identity of the initial seed generates a large shift in the locations of expected diffusion path. We show that both of these results still hold when the vanishing measurement error is only local in nature. Such non-robustness in forecasting exists even under conditions where the basic reproductive number is consistently estimable.

Similar to the spread of rumors or influence in an online social network, it has been observed that failures (outages) in a power grid can spread contagiously, driven by viral spread mechanisms. We employ a stochastic diffusion model that is Markovian (memoryless) and local (the activation of one node, i.e., transmission line, can only be caused by its neighbors). Our model integrates viral diffusion principles with physics-based concepts, by correlating the diffusion weights (contagion probabilities between transmission lines) with the hyperparametric Information Cascades (IC) model. We show that this diffusion model can be learned from traces of cascading failures, enabling accurate modeling and prediction of failure propagation. This approach facilitates actionable information through well-understood and efficient graph analysis methods and graph diffusion simulations. Furthermore, by leveraging the hyperparametric model, we can predict diffusion and mitigate the risks of cascading failures even in unseen grid configurations, whereas existing methods falter due to a lack of training data.

Due to the dependency on digital media, a person shares important information or regular updates with friends and family. The set of persons on social media forms a social network. Influence Maximization (IM) is a known problem in social networks. In social networks, information flows from one person to another using an underlying diffusion model. There are two fundamental diffusion models: the Independent Cascade Model (ICM) and the Linear Threshold Model (LTM). In this paper, we study a variant of the IM problem called Minimum Influential Seeds (MINFS) problem proposed by Qiang et al.[16]. It generalizes the classical IM problem with LTM as the diffusion model. Compared to IM, this variant has additional parameters: the influence threshold for each node and the propagation range. The propagation range is a positive integer that specifies how far the information can propagate from a node. A node on the network is not immediately influenced until it receives the same information from enough number of neighbors (influence threshold). Similarly, any node does not forward information until it receives the same information from a sufficient number of neighbors (activation threshold). Once a node becomes activated, it tries to activate or influence its neighbors. The MINFS problem aims to select the minimum number of initial spreader nodes such that all nodes of the graph are influenced. In this paper, we extend the study of the MINFS problem. We propose heuristics that construct seed sets based on the average degree of non-activated nodes, closest first, and backbone-based heaviest path."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08899": {"title": "ESND: An Embedding-based Framework for Signed Network Dismantling", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08899", "description": "arXiv:2406.08899v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Network dismantling aims to maximize the disintegration of a network by removing a specific set of nodes or edges and is applied to various tasks in diverse domains, such as cracking down on crime organizations, delaying the propagation of rumors, and blocking the transmission of viruses.

To illustrate the efficacy and stability of ESND, we conduct extensive experiments on six signed network datasets as well as null models, and compare the performance of our method with baselines. Experimental results consistently show that the proposed ESND is superior to the baselines and displays stable performance with the change in the network structure.

Such a generalization is inspired by the need to accurately model content propagation over online social networks (OSNs). The key question investigated is the time-asymptotic proportion of the populations, which translates to the proportional visibility of the posts on the OSN. We provide the answer using a stochastic approximation (SA) technique, which has not been used in the existing BP literature. The analysis is derived using a non-trivial autonomous measurable ODE. Interestingly, we prove the possibility of a new limiting behaviour for the stochastic trajectory, named as hovering around. Such a result is not just new to the theory of BPs but also to the SA based literature.\n  Later, we explore three new variants of BPs: (i) any living individual of a population can attack and acquire the living individuals of the other population, in addition to producing its offspring; (ii) the individuals can die due to abnormal circumstances, and not just at the completion of their lifetimes; (iii) the expected number of offspring decreases as the total-population increases, leading to the saturation of the total-population.\n  Such variants aid in analysing unexplored aspects of content propagation over OSNs: (i) competition in advertisement posts for similar products; (ii) controlling fake-post propagation, while not affecting the sharing of real-post; (iii) impact of re-forwarding the posts.

There are two main approaches to solving this task. On one hand are traversal-based algorithms like bidirectional breadth-first search (BiBFS) with no preprocessing step and slow individual distance inquiries. On the other hand are indexing-based approaches, which maintain a large index. This allows for answering individual inquiries very fast; however, index creation is prohibitively expensive. We seek to bridge these two extremes: quickly answer distance inquiries without the need for costly preprocessing.\n  In this work, we propose a new algorithm and data structure, WormHole, for approximate shortest path computations. WormHole leverages structural properties of social networks to build a sublinearly sized index, drawing upon the explicit core-periphery decomposition of Ben-Eliezer et al. Empirically, the preprocessing time of WormHole improves upon index-based solutions by orders of magnitude, and individual inquiries are consistently much faster than in BiBFS. The acceleration comes at the cost of a minor accuracy trade-off. Nonetheless, our empirical evidence demonstrates that WormHole accurately answers essentially all inquiries within a maximum additive error of 2. We complement these empirical results with provable theoretical guarantees, showing that WormHole requires $n^{o(1)}$ node queries per distance inquiry in random power-law networks. In contrast, any approach without a preprocessing step requires $n^{\\Omega(1)}$ queries for the same task.\n  WormHole does not require reading the whole graph.

The intuition is that topic shifts from a non-political topic to politics are a direct measure of politicization -- making something political, and that the more people switch conversations to politics, the more they perceive politics as playing a vital role in their daily lives. A fundamental challenge that must be addressed when one studies politicization in social media is that, a priori, any topic may be politicized. Hence, any keyword-based method or even machine learning approaches that rely on topic labels to classify topics are expensive to run and potentially ineffective.

By controlling inauthentic accounts impersonating humans, malicious actors can amplify disinformation within target communities. The consequences of such operations are difficult to evaluate due to the challenges posed by collecting data and carrying out ethical experiments that would influence online communities. Here we use a social media model that simulates information diffusion in an empirical network to quantify the impacts of several adversarial manipulation tactics on the quality of content. We find that the presence of influential accounts, a hallmark of social media, exacerbates the vulnerabilities of online communities to manipulation. Among the explored tactics that bad actors can employ, infiltrating a community is the most likely to make low-quality content go viral. Such harm can be further compounded by inauthentic agents flooding the network with low-quality, yet appealing content, but is mitigated when bad actors focus on specific targets, such as influential or vulnerable individuals. These insights suggest countermeasures that platforms could employ to increase the resilience of social media users to manipulation."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14533": {"title": "Context-Aware Prediction of User Engagement on Online Social Platforms", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14533", "description": "arXiv:2310.14533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: The success of online social platforms hinges on their ability to predict and understand user behavior at scale. Here, we present data suggesting that context-aware modeling approaches may offer a holistic yet lightweight and potentially privacy-preserving representation of user engagement on online social platforms. Leveraging deep LSTM neural networks to analyze more than 100 million Snapchat sessions from almost 80.000 users, we demonstrate that patterns of active and passive use are predictable from past behavior (R2=0.345) and that the integration of context features substantially improves predictive performance compared to the behavioral baseline model (R2=0.522). Features related to smartphone connectivity status, location, temporal context, and weather were found to capture non-redundant variance in user engagement relative to features derived from histories of in-app behaviors. Further, we show that a large proportion of variance can be accounted for with minimal behavioral histories if momentary context is considered (R2=0.442). These results indicate the potential of context-aware approaches for making models more efficient and privacy-preserving by reducing the need for long data histories.

Recent schemes for link prediction in such dynamic settings employ Transformers, modeling individual graph updates as single tokens. In this work, we propose HOT: a model that enhances this line of works by harnessing higher-order (HO) graph structures; specifically, k-hop neighbors and more general subgraphs containing a given pair of vertices. Harnessing such HO structures by encoding them into the attention matrix of the underlying Transformer results in higher accuracy of link prediction outcomes, but at the expense of increased memory pressure. To alleviate this, we resort to a recent class of schemes that impose hierarchy on the attention matrix, significantly reducing memory footprint.

We define Input/Output Directed Graphs (or IOD Graphs) as graphs with nodes $N$ and directed edges $E$, where $N$ contains (a) a set of ``input nodes'' $I \\subset N$, where each $i \\in I$ has no incoming edges and any number of outgoing edges, and (b) a set of ``output nodes'' $O \\subset N$, where each $o \\in O$ has no outgoing edges and any number of incoming edges, and $I\\cap O = \\emptyset$. We define informativeness, which involves the connections via directed paths from the input nodes to the output nodes: A partially informative IOD Graph has at least one path from an input to an output, a very informative IOD Graph has a path from every input to some output, and a fully informative IOD Graph has a path from every input to every output.\n  A perceptron is an example of an IOD Graph. If it has non-zero weights and any number of layers, it is fully informative. As links are removed (assigned zero weight), the perceptron might become very, partially, or not informative.\n  We define a crossover operation on IOD Graphs in which we find subgraphs with matching sets of forward and backward directed links to ``swap.'' With this operation, IOD Graphs can be subject to evolutionary computation methods. We show that fully informative parents may yield a non-informative child. We also show that under conditions of contiguousness and the no dangling nodes condition, crossover compatible, partially informative parents yield partially informative children, and very informative input parents with partially informative output parents yield very informative children.

Disaster relief management plays a crucial role in enhancing the lifestyle of disaster victims by managing the disaster impacts. Disaster relief management is a process with many collaborative sectors where different stakeholders should operate in all major phases of the disaster management progression. In the different phases of the disaster management process, many collaborative government organisations along with nongovernment organisations, leadership, community, and media at different levels need to share the responsibility with disaster victims to achieve effective disaster relief management. Shared responsibility enhances disaster relief management effectiveness and reduces the disaster's impact on the victims. Considering the diverse roles of different stakeholders, there has been a need for a framework that can bind different stakeholders together during disaster management. this paper shows a framework with major stakeholders of disaster relief management and how different stakeholders can take part in an effective disaster relief management process. The framework also highlights how each stakeholder can contribute to relief management at different phases after a disaster. The paper also explores some of the shared responsibility collaborative practices that have been implemented around the world in response to the disaster as a disaster relief management process.

We propose a higher-order meta-population model that captures large-scale global cross-regional mobility and small-scale higher-order interactions within regions. Remarkably, we extend the dimension-reduction approach, simplifying the N-dimensional higher-order meta-population system into a one-dimensional equation by decomposing different network behaviours into a single universal resilience function, thereby allowing for convenient and accurate prediction of the system resilience. The network structure and human mobility parameters can clearly and simply express the epidemic threshold. Numerical experimental results on both real networks and star networks confirm the accuracy of the proposed dimension-reduction framework in predicting the evolution of epidemic dynamics on higher-order meta-population networks.

This mechanism is explored, in isolation, via a minimal model where PageRank serves to score the available opportunities. Despite its simplicity, this model gives rise to rich node dynamics, path-dependence, and an unexpected degenerate structure. We go on to argue that this model might be useful to theoretical development as a maximally stylised model of entrepreneurial growth. Central to the argument is an alternative set of microfoundations introduced in Leontief & Brody (1993) whereby the steady state of a random walk is a notion of economic equilibrium. To the extent this argument holds, our findings suggest that entrepreneurs face a shifting \"opportunity space\" where the number of potential business opportunities is effectively unbounded.

An early stage infodemic is characterized by a large volume of unlabeled information concerning a disease. As a result, conventional misinformation detection methods are not suitable for this misinformation detection task because they rely on labeled information in the infodemic domain to train their models. To address the limitation of conventional methods, state-of-the-art methods learn their models using labeled information in other domains to detect misinformation in the infodemic domain. The efficacy of these methods depends on their ability to mitigate both covariate shift and concept shift between the infodemic domain and the domains from which they leverage labeled information. These methods focus on mitigating covariate shift but overlook concept shift, rendering them less effective for the task. In response, we theoretically show the necessity of tackling both covariate shift and concept shift as well as how to operationalize each of them.

This paper presents an idealistic but feasible model for economic freedom on Mars, which is situated within a framework in which Mars has been designated as a sovereign juridical peer to Earth. Under such conditions, Mars could maintain monetary stability through full reserve banking and a restriction on exchange with any fractional reserve Earth currencies, with a volume of circulating currency that changes based on the total population within fixed capacity infrastructure. Mars could maintain long-term political stability by diffusing the ownership of capital on Mars, which would allow all citizens of Mars to draw sufficient wealth from a combination of capital ownership and labor to live a good life. This model could also support limited tourism on Mars, in which real goods are exchanged for services but currency transactions between planets are prohibited. This model demonstrates the potential for a viable and sustainable economy on Mars that could conceivably be implemented, including on a sovereign Mars but also in other scenarios of space settlement.

As a kind of universal graph prompt learning method, Graph Prompt Feature (GPF) has achieved remarkable success in adapting pre-trained models for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). By fixing the parameters of a pre-trained GNN model, the aim of GPF is to modify the input graph data by adding some (learnable) prompt vectors into graph node features to better align with the downstream tasks on the smaller dataset. However, existing GPFs generally suffer from two main limitations. First, GPFs generally focus on node prompt learning which ignore the prompting for graph edges. Second, existing GPFs generally conduct the prompt learning on all nodes equally which fails to capture the importances of different nodes and may perform sensitively w.r.t noisy nodes in aligning with the downstream tasks. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a new unified Graph Selective Prompt Feature learning (GSPF) for GNN fine-tuning. The proposed GSPF integrates the prompt learning on both graph node and edge together, which thus provides a unified prompt model for the graph data. Moreover, it conducts prompt learning selectively on nodes and edges by concentrating on the important nodes and edges for prompting which thus make our model be more reliable and compact.

We also demonstrate that the semantic structure of news articles from opposing partisan sides, as represented in document-level graph embeddings, have significant similarities.

However, edge classification task that enjoys numerous real-world applications such as social network analysis and cybersecurity, has not seen significant advancement. To address this gap, our study pioneers a comprehensive approach to edge classification. We identify a novel `Topological Imbalance Issue', which arises from the skewed distribution of edges across different classes, affecting the local subgraph of each edge and harming the performance of edge classifications. Inspired by the recent studies in node classification that the performance discrepancy exists with varying local structural patterns, we aim to investigate if the performance discrepancy in topological imbalanced edge classification can also be mitigated by characterizing the local class distribution variance. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Topological Entropy (TE), a novel topological-based metric that measures the topological imbalance for each edge. Our empirical studies confirm that TE effectively measures local class distribution variance, and indicate that prioritizing edges with high TE values can help address the issue of topological imbalance. Based on this, we develop two strategies - Topological Reweighting and TE Wedge-based Mixup - to focus training on (synthetic) edges based on their TEs. While topological reweighting directly manipulates training edge weights according to TE, our wedge-based mixup interpolates synthetic edges between high TE wedges. Ultimately, we integrate these strategies into a novel topological imbalance strategy for edge classification: TopoEdge. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed strategies on newly curated datasets and thus establish a new benchmark for (imbalanced) edge classification."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11729": {"title": "Secure Cross-Chain Provenance for Digital Forensics Collaboration", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11729", "description": "arXiv:2406.11729v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: In digital forensics and various sectors like medicine and supply chain, blockchains play a crucial role in providing a secure and tamper-resistant system that meticulously records every detail, ensuring accountability.

To estimate and weaken the DE of neighboring nodes, we propose a Causally graph Attention network for Trimming heterophilic graph (CAT).

In this work, the diversity of strategies is introduced into the weak prisoners' dilemma game, which is measured by the diversity of the cooperation tendency. A higher diversity means more cooperation tendencies are provided. The complete cooperation strategy is the full cooperation tendency and the complete defection strategy is without any cooperation tendency. Agents with other cooperation tendencies behave as partial cooperators and as partial defectors simultaneously. The numerical simulation shows that increasing the diversity of the cooperation tendency promotes the cooperation level, not only the number of cooperators but also the average tendency over the whole population, until the diversity reaches its saturated value. Furthermore, our work points out maintaining cooperation is based on the cooperation efficiency approximating to the reward of cooperators and that the cooperation efficiency oscillates and quickly decreases to zero when cooperator clusters cannot resist the invasion of defectors.

The European steel industry is seeking to reduce its emissions by increasing the use of electric arc furnaces (EAFs), which can produce steel from scrap, marking a major shift towards a circular steel economy. Here, we show by combining trade with business intelligence data that this shift requires a deep restructuring of the global and European scrap trade, as well as a substantial scaling of the underlying business ecosystem. We find that the scrap imports of European countries with major EAF installations have steadily decreased since 2007 while globally scrap trade started to increase recently. Our statistical modelling shows that every 1,000 tonnes of EAF capacity installed is associated with an increase in annual imports of 550 tonnes and a decrease in annual exports of 1,000 tonnes of scrap, suggesting increased competition for scrap metal as countries ramp up their EAF capacity. Furthermore, each scrap company enables an increase of around 79,000 tonnes of EAF-based steel production per year in the EU. Taking these relations as causal and extrapolating to the currently planned EAF capacity, we find that an additional 730 (SD 140) companies might be required, employing about 35,000 people (IQR 29,000-50,000) and generating an additional estimated turnover of USD 35 billion (IQR 27-48).

A key graph mining primitive is extracting dense subgraphs, and this has led to interesting notions such as K-cores, known as building blocks of complex networks. Despite recent attempts to extend the notion of core to multiplex networks, existing studies suffer from a subset of the following limitations: They 1) force all nodes to exhibit their high degree in the same set of relation types while in multiplex networks some connection types can be noisy for some nodes, 2) either require high computational cost or miss the complex information of multiplex networks, and 3) assume the same importance for all relation types. We introduce S-core, a novel and unifying family of dense structures in multiplex networks that uses a function S(.) to summarize the degree vector of each node. We then discuss how one can choose a proper S(.) from the data. To demonstrate the usefulness of S-cores, we focus on finding the densest subgraph as well as modeling user engagement in multiplex networks. We present a new density measure in multiplex networks and discuss its advantages over existing density measures. We show that the problem of finding the densest subgraph in multiplex networks is NP-hard and design an efficient approximation algorithm based on S-cores. Finally, we present a new mathematical model of user engagement in the presence of different relation types. Our experiments shows the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithms and supports the proposed mathematical model of user engagement."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13789": {"title": "Death, Taxes, and Inequality", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13789", "description": "arXiv:2406.13789v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Income inequalities and redistribution policies are modeled with a minimal, endogenous model of a simple foraging economy.

However, achieving structure fairness in dynamic graph embedding remains an open problem. Neglecting degree changes in dynamic graphs will significantly impair embedding effectiveness without notably improving structure fairness. This is because the embedding performance of high-degree and low-to-high-degree vertices will significantly drop close to the generally poorer embedding performance of most slightly changed vertices in the long-tail part of the power-law distribution. We first identify biased structural evolutions in a dynamic graph based on the evolving trend of vertex degree and then propose FairDGE, the first structurally Fair Dynamic Graph Embedding algorithm. FairDGE learns biased structural evolutions by jointly embedding the connection changes among vertices and the long-short-term evolutionary trend of vertex degrees. Furthermore, a novel dual debiasing approach is devised to encode fair embeddings contrastively, customizing debiasing strategies for different biased structural evolutions. This innovative debiasing strategy breaks the effectiveness bottleneck of embeddings without notable fairness loss.

To address this limitation, we systematically investigate the adversarial robustness of GNNs by considering graph data patterns, model-specific factors, and the transferability of adversarial examples. Through extensive experiments, a set of principled guidelines is obtained for improving the adversarial robustness of GNNs, for example: (i) rather than highly regular graphs, the training graph data with diverse structural patterns is crucial for model robustness, which is consistent with the concept of adversarial training; (ii) the large model capacity of GNNs with sufficient training data has a positive effect on model robustness, and only a small percentage of neurons in GNNs are affected by adversarial attacks; (iii) adversarial transfer is not symmetric and the adversarial examples produced by the small-capacity model have stronger adversarial transferability.

The weather conditions responsible for these challenges have been well-studied in the literature. However, in reality multi-day resilience challenges are triggered by complex interactions between high demand, low renewable availability, electricity transmission constraints and storage dynamics. We show these challenges cannot be rigorously understood from an exclusively power systems, or meteorological, perspective. We propose a new method that uses electricity shadow prices - obtained by a European power system model based on 40 years of reanalysis data - to identify the most difficult periods driving system investments. Such difficult periods are driven by large-scale weather conditions such as low wind and cold temperature periods of various lengths associated with stationary high pressure over Europe. However, purely meteorological approaches fail to identify which events lead to the largest system stress over the multi-decadal study period due to the influence of subtle transmission bottlenecks and storage issues across multiple regions. These extreme events also do not relate strongly to traditional weather patterns (such as Euro-Atlantic weather regimes or the North Atlantic Oscillation index).

Our findings reveal that cooperative bots significantly enhance cooperation in both population types across these strategic approaches under weak imitation scenarios, where players are less concerned with material gains. However, under strong imitation scenarios, while cooperative bots do not alter the defective equilibrium in well-mixed populations, they have varied impacts in structured populations across these strategic approaches. Specifically, they disrupt cooperation under discrete and continuous strategies but facilitate it under mixed strategies.

Traditional models of social learning by imitation are based on simple contagion -- where an individual may imitate a more successful neighbor following a single interaction. Our framework generalizes this process to incorporate complex contagion, which requires multiple exposures before an individual considers adopting a different behavior. We formulate this as a discrete time and state stochastic process in a finite population, and we derive its continuum limit as an ordinary differential equation that generalizes the replicator equation, the most widely used dynamical model in evolutionary game theory. When applied to linear frequency-dependent games, our social learning with complex contagion produces qualitatively different outcomes than traditional imitation dynamics: it can shift the Prisoner's Dilemma from a unique all-defector equilibrium to either a stable mixture of cooperators and defectors in the population, or a bistable system; it changes the Snowdrift game from a single to a bistable equilibrium; and it can alter the Coordination game from bistability at the boundaries to two internal equilibria.

Furthermore, the advantage of the proposed personalized edge-flipping mechanism is also supported by its numerical performance on various synthetic networks and a real-life multi-layer network."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14894": {"title": "Talking the Talk Does Not Entail Walking the Walk: On the Limits of Large Language Models in Lexical Entailment Recognition", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14894", "description": "arXiv:2406.14894v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Verbs form the backbone of language, providing the structure and meaning to sentences.

It performs communication among agents within the system to collaboratively solve tasks, under the premise of shared information. However, when agents' communication is leveraged to enhance human cooperation, a new challenge arises due to information asymmetry, since each agent can only access the information of its human user. Previous MAS struggle to complete tasks under this condition. To address this, we propose a new MAS paradigm termed iAgents, which denotes Informative Multi-Agent Systems. In iAgents, the human social network is mirrored in the agent network, where agents proactively exchange human information necessary for task resolution, thereby overcoming information asymmetry. iAgents employs a novel agent reasoning mechanism, InfoNav, to navigate agents' communication towards effective information exchange. Together with InfoNav, iAgents organizes human information in a mixed memory to provide agents with accurate and comprehensive information for exchange. Additionally, we introduce InformativeBench, the first benchmark tailored for evaluating LLM agents' task-solving ability under information asymmetry. Experimental results show that iAgents can collaborate within a social network of 140 individuals and 588 relationships, autonomously communicate over 30 turns, and retrieve information from nearly 70,000 messages to complete tasks within 3 minutes."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15038": {"title": "Online detection and infographic explanation of spam reviews with data drift adaptation", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15038", "description": "arXiv:2406.15038v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Spam reviews are a pervasive problem on online platforms due to its significant impact on reputation.

To this end, a disruption index (CD) was recently developed and applied to publication and patent citation networks (Wu et al., Nature 2019; Park et al., Nature 2023). Here we show that CD systematically decreases over time due to secular growth in research and patent production, following two distinct mechanisms unrelated to innovation -- one behavioral and the other structural. Whereas the behavioral explanation reflects shifts associated with techno-social factors (e.g. self-citation practices), the structural explanation follows from `citation inflation' (CI), an inextricable feature of real citation networks attributable to increasing reference list lengths, which causes CD to systematically decrease. We demonstrate this causal link by way of mathematical deduction, computational simulation, multi-variate regression, and quasi-experimental comparison of the disruptiveness of PNAS versus PNAS Plus articles, which differ only in their lengths. Accordingly, we analyze CD data available in the SciSciNet database and find that disruptiveness incrementally increased from 2005-2015, and that the negative relationship between disruption and team-size is remarkably small in overall magnitude effect size, and shifts from negative to positive for team size $\\geq$ 8 coauthors."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00053": {"title": "A new understanding on the history of developing MRI for cancer detection", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00053", "description": "arXiv:2405.00053v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Science is about facts and truth.

The complexities of peer selection and evolving peer relationships, however, pose challenges for identifying peer effects using static observational data. Here we use both null-model and regression approaches to examine peer effects using longitudinal data from 5,272 undergraduates, where roommate assignments are plausibly random upon enrollment and roommate relationships persist until graduation. Specifically, we construct a roommate null model by randomly shuffling students among dorm rooms and introduce an assimilation metric to quantify similarities in roommate academic performance. We find significantly larger assimilation in actual data than in the roommate null model, suggesting roommate peer effects, whereby roommates have more similar performance than expected by chance alone. Moreover, assimilation exhibits an overall increasing trend over time, suggesting that peer effects become stronger the longer roommates live together. Our regression analysis further reveals the moderating role of peer heterogeneity. In particular, when roommates perform similarly, the positive relationship between a student's future performance and their roommates' average prior performance is more pronounced, and their ordinal rank in the dorm room has an independent effect.

We create our recommender in two ways, by taking into account ingredients appearances in recipes or shared flavor compounds between foods.

Furthermore, and more interestingly, we find that food pairing in data is mostly due to trivial couplings of very similar ingredients, leading to a reconsideration of its current role in recipes, from being an already existing feature to a key to open up new scenarios in gastronomy.

For the EDL, we show that the relative rate of fear acquisition to disease transmission controls the size of the fearful population at the end of a disease outbreak, and that the fear-induced contact reduction behaviour has very little impact on disease burden. Conversely, we show that in the NDL, disease burden can be controlled by fear-induced behaviour depending on the rate of fear loss. Specifically, fear-induced behaviour introduces a contact parameter $p$, which if too large prevents the contact reduction from effectively managing the epidemic.

However, the limited availability of vaccines and personnel at the roll-out of a new vaccine, as well as the costs of vaccination campaigns, might limit how many people can be vaccinated. Network immunization thus focuses on selecting a fixed-size subset of individuals to vaccinate so as to minimize the disease spread. In this paper, we consider simulation-optimization approaches for this selection problem. Here, the simulation of disease spread in an activity-based contact graph allows us to consider the effect of contact tracing and a limited willingness to test and quarantine. First, we develop a stochastic programming algorithm based on sampling infection forests from the simulation. Second, we propose a genetic algorithm that is tailored to the immunization problem and combines simulation runs of different sizes to balance the time needed to find promising solutions with the uncertainty resulting from simulation. Both approaches are tested on data from a major university in Denmark and disease characteristics representing those of COVID-19. Our results show that the proposed methods are competitive with a large number of centrality-based measures over a range of disease parameters and that the proposed methods are able to outperform them for a considerable number of these instances. Finally, we compare network immunization against our previously proposed approach of limiting distinct contacts.

We find that comparisons between the two principles of utilitarianism and egalitarianism dominate in assessments of distributive justice, with the latter most often considered representing a \"just energy system\". The lack of recognition of alternative and equally valid principles of justice, resting on e.g. capabilities, responsibilities and/or opportunities, leads to a narrow understanding of justice that fails to align with the views of different individuals, stakeholders and societies. More importantly, it can lead to the unjust design of future energy systems and energy systems analysis.

Traditional approaches primarily analyze specific structural features of the network; however, node influence is typically the result of a combination of multiple factors. Machine learning-based methods struggle to effectively represent the complex characteristics of network structures through suitable embedding techniques and require substantial data for training, rendering them prohibitively costly for large-scale networks. To address these challenges, this paper presents an active learning model based on GraphSAGE and Transformer, named GNNTAL. This model is initially pre-trained on random or synthetic networks and subsequently fine-tuned on real-world networks by selecting a few representative nodes using K-Means clustering and uncertainty sampling. This approach offers two main advantages: (1) it significantly reduces training costs; (2) it simultaneously incorporates both local and global features. A series of comparative experiments conducted on twelve real-world networks demonstrate that GNNTAL achieves superior performance. Additionally, this paper proposes an influence maximization method based on the predictions of the GNNTAL model, which achieves optimal performance without the need for complex computations.

The active part of the ego network of words only includes words that are regularly used by individuals, akin to the ego networks in the social domain, where the active part includes relationships regularly nurtured by individuals and hence demanding cognitive effort. In this work, we define a methodology for extracting the active part of the ego network of words and validate it using interview transcripts and tweets. The robustness of our method to varying input data sizes and temporal stability is demonstrated. We also demonstrate that without the active network concept (and a tool for properly extracting the active network from data), the \"ego network of words\" model is not able to properly estimate the cognitive effort involved and it becomes vulnerable to the amount of data considered (leading to the disappearance of the layered structure in large datasets).

In this paper, we introduce an adaptive network model in the snowdrift game to examine dynamic levels of cooperation and network topology, involving the potential for both the termination of existing connections and the establishment of new ones. In particular, we define the agent's asymmetric disassociation tendency toward their neighbors, which fundamentally determines the probability of edge dismantlement. The mechanism allows agents to selectively sever and rewire their connections to alternative individuals to refine partnerships. Our findings reveal that adaptive networks are particularly effective in promoting a robust evolution toward states of either pure cooperation or complete defection, especially under conditions of extreme cost-benefit ratios, as compared to static network models.

It was introduced in the social sciences and statistics as a model of communities, and in theoretical computer science as an average case model for graph partitioning problems under the name of the ``planted partition model.'' Given a sparse stochastic block model, the two standard inference tasks are: (i) Weak recovery: can we estimate the communities with non trivial overlap with the true communities? (ii) Detection/Hypothesis testing: can we distinguish if the sample was drawn from the block model or from a random graph with no community structure with probability tending to $1$ as the graph size tends to infinity?\n  In this work, we show that for sparse stochastic block models, the two inference tasks are equivalent except at a critical point. That is, weak recovery is information theoretically possible if and only if detection is possible. We thus find a strong connection between these two notions of inference for the model. We further prove that when detection is impossible, an explicit hypothesis test based on low degree polynomials in the adjacency matrix of the observed graph achieves the optimal statistical power. This low degree test is efficient as opposed to the likelihood ratio test, which is not known to be efficient.

Neither person-specific modeling nor fine-tuning on person-specific data substantially outperformed the global models, indicating that the global models were able to represent a variety of idiosyncratic behavioral patterns. Additionally, our analyses reveal that the person-level predictability of social media use is not substantially related to the frequency of smartphone use in general or the frequency of social media use, indicating that our approach captures an aspect of habits that is distinct from behavioral frequency.

In this work, we develop a network model of multidimensional social interactions to tackle two crucial questions: What is the structure of our latent connection preferences, and how do we integrate information from our multidimensional identities to connect with others? To answer these questions, we systematically model different latent preference structures and preference aggregation mechanisms. Then, we compare them using Bayesian model selection by fitting empirical data from high school friendship networks. We find that a simple latent preference model consistently outperforms more complex alternatives. The calibrated model provides robust measures of latent connection preferences in real-world networks, bringing insights into how one- and multidimensional groups interact.

As such, outcomes such as \"in 50% of the cases, no one of group 1 receives the information and everyone in group 2 receives it and in other 50%, the opposite happens\", which always results in largely unfair outcomes, are classified as fair by a variety of fairness metrics in the literature.

However, GNNs may contain of sensitive information and susceptible to privacy attacks. For example, link stealing is a type of attack in which attackers infer whether two nodes are linked or not. Previous link stealing attacks primarily relied on posterior probabilities from the target GNN model, neglecting the significance of node features. Additionally, variations in node classes across different datasets lead to different dimensions of posterior probabilities. The handling of these varying data dimensions posed a challenge in using a single model to effectively conduct link stealing attacks on different datasets. To address these challenges, we introduce Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform link stealing attacks on GNNs. LLMs can effectively integrate textual features and exhibit strong generalizability, enabling attacks to handle diverse data dimensions across various datasets. We design two distinct LLM prompts to effectively combine textual features and posterior probabilities of graph nodes.

Furthermore, we fine-tune the LLM using multiple datasets and enable the LLM to learn features from different datasets simultaneously.

The analysis focuses on: (1) the extent of heterogeneity in lifestyle recovery of residents in the same spatial area; and (2) the extent to which variations in lifestyle recovery and its heterogeneity among users can be explained based on hazard impact extent and social vulnerability. As lifestyle recovery progresses, heterogeneity diminishes, indicating that lower lifestyle recovery rates correlate with higher heterogeneity within a spatial area.

The fundamental particularity of our model is that only a pairwise interaction between agents of the opposite class is allowed. Agent fitness can thus only change by competition among the two classes, while the total fitness in the society remains constant. The main result is that for a broad range of values of the model parameters, the fitness of the agents of each class show a decay in time except for one or very few agents which capture almost all the fitness in the society. Numerical simulations also reveal a singular shift from egalitarian to hierarchical society for each class.

We collected 828 papers from 10 well-known databases, systematically screened them and analysed the final 61 papers. Our analyses reveal several prominent task formulations $-$ including empathy on localised utterances or overall expressions, unidirectional or parallel empathy, and emotional contagion $-$ in monadic, dyadic and group interactions. Empathy detection methods are summarised based on four input modalities $-$ text, audiovisual, audio and physiological signals $-$ thereby presenting modality-specific network architecture design protocols. We discuss challenges, research gaps and potential applications in the Affective Computing-based empathy domain, which can facilitate new avenues of exploration. We further enlist the public availability of datasets and codes. We believe that our work is a stepping stone to developing a robust empathy detection system that can be deployed in practice to enhance the overall well-being of human life."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18617": {"title": "Similarities among top one day batters: physics-based quantification", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18617", "description": "arXiv:2406.18617v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Assessment of the performance of a player in any sport is very much needed to determine the ranking of players and make a solid team with the best players. Besides these, fans, journalists, sports persons, and sports councils often analyse the performances of current and retired players to identify the best players of all time. Here, we study the performance of all-time top batters in one-day cricket using physics-based statistical methods. The batters are selected in this study who possess either higher total runs or a high number of centuries. It is found that the total runs increases linearly with the innings number at the later stage of the batter carrier, and the runs rate estimated from the linear regression analysis also increases linearly with the average runs. The probability of non-scoring innings is found to be a negligibly small number (i.e., $\\leq 0.1$ ) for each batter. Furthermore, based on innings-wise runs, we have computed the six-dimensional probability distribution vector for each player. Two components of the probability distribution vector vary linearly with average runs. The component representing the probability of scoring runs less than 50 linearly decreases with the average runs. In contrast, the probability of scoring runs greater than or equal to 100 and less than 150 linearly increases with the average runs. We have also estimated the entropy to assess the diversity of a player. Interestingly, the entropy varies linearly with the average runs, giving rise to two clusters corresponding to the old and recent players. Furthermore, the angle between two probability vectors is calculated for each pair of players to measure the similarities among the players. It is found that some of the players are almost identical to each other."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18761": {"title": "Why Teach Quantum In Your Own Time: The Values of Grassroots Organizations Involved in Quantum Technologies Education and Outreach", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18761", "description": "arXiv:2406.18761v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This paper examines the intersection of goals and values within grassroots organizations operating in the realm of quantum technologies (QT) education.

The Cournot Oligopoly models economic actors as rational players attempting to maximise profit by optimising supply quantities with analytical results now consolidated about equilibrium characteristics where transport conditions are fixed. Similarly, where supply and demand are fixed, the routing of goods in a transport network can be analytically solved through a traffic assignment problem.

Utilising a temporal analysis framework, we identify consistent daily posting trends on the parent platform and uncover contrasting behaviours when comparing intra-platform and cross-platform activities. Our findings reveal that Threads engages more with political and AI-related topics, compared to Instagram which focuses more on lifestyle and fashion topics. Our analysis also shows that user activities align more closely on weekends across both platforms.

Understanding this concept and its related metrics is crucial for designing effective Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The most widely used homophily metrics, such as edge or node homophily, quantify such \"similarity\" as label consistency across the graph topology. These metrics are believed to be able to reflect the performance of GNNs, especially on node-level tasks. However, many recent studies have empirically demonstrated that the performance of GNNs does not always align with homophily metrics, and how homophily influences GNNs still remains unclear and controversial. Then, a crucial question arises: What is missing in our current understanding of homophily? To figure out the missing part, in this paper, we disentangle the graph homophily into $3$ aspects: label, structural, and feature homophily, providing a more comprehensive understanding of GNN performance. To investigate their synergy, we propose a Contextual Stochastic Block Model with $3$ types of Homophily (CSBM-3H), where the topology and feature generation are controlled by the $3$ metrics. Based on the theoretical analysis of CSBM-3H, we derive a new composite metric, named Tri-Hom, that considers all $3$ aspects and overcomes the limitations of conventional homophily metrics. The theoretical conclusions and the effectiveness of Tri-Hom have been verified through synthetic experiments on CSBM-3H. In addition, we conduct experiments on $31$ real-world benchmark datasets and calculate the correlations between homophily metrics and model performance. Tri-Hom has significantly higher correlation values than $17$ existing metrics that only focus on a single homophily aspect, demonstrating its superiority and the importance of homophily synergy.

Typical assemblies, frequently combined building blocks in past innovations, compress and curve the space of possibilities toward what is imaginable, accessible, and implementable, much like gravitational forces on new ideas and actions. We demonstrate that these curvatures in the space of possibilities are not just abstract constructs but empirically measurable through two complementary studies. We first show that Edison's inventions are primarily located in areas of high curvature, aligning with his strategy of building upon institutionalized domains. In contrast, Tesla's inventions are mainly found in low-curvature areas, indicating his propensity for exploring new territories and pushing innovation boundaries. Further analysis of the entire U.S. patent database reveals that innovations in high-curvature areas are more likely to yield monetary value.

Existing heterophilic GNNs tend to ignore the modeling of heterophily of each edge, which is also a vital part in tackling the heterophily problem. In this paper, we firstly propose a heterophily-aware attention scheme and reveal the benefits of modeling the edge heterophily, i.e., if a GNN assigns different weights to edges according to different heterophilic types, it can learn effective local attention patterns, which enable nodes to acquire appropriate information from distinct neighbors. Then, we propose a novel Heterophily-Aware Graph Attention Network (HA-GAT) by fully exploring and utilizing the local distribution as the underlying heterophily, to handle the networks with different homophily ratios. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HA-GAT, we analyze the proposed heterophily-aware attention scheme and local distribution exploration, by seeking for an interpretation from their mechanism.

An important question in this setting is parameter estimation: how to disentangle the effects of social pressure to estimate inherent beliefs from declared opinions. This is useful for forecasting when agents' declared opinions are influenced by social pressure while real-world behavior only depends on their inherent beliefs. To address this, Jadbabaie et al. formulated the Interacting P\\'olya Urn model of opinion dynamics under social pressure and studied it on complete-graph social networks using an aggregate estimator, and found that their estimator converges to the inherent beliefs unless majority pressure pushes the network to consensus.\n  In this work, we studythis model on arbitrary networks, providing an estimator which converges to the inherent beliefs even in consensus situations.

The fifth principle, Care, is generally surpassed by others, which are higher in the radicalized groups' moral hierarchy. Moreover, the presented data-driven methodological framework proposes an alternative way to measure whether a community complies with some moral principle or foundation: not evaluating its speech, but its behavior through interactions of its individuals, establishing a bridge between structural features of the interaction network and the intensity of communities' radicalization regarding the considered moral foundations.

However, in polarized contexts, citizens not only adopt more extreme views but also become correlated across issues that are, a priori, seemingly unrelated. This phenomenon, known as \"ideological sorting\", has been receiving greater attention in recent years but the micro-level mechanisms underlying its emergence remain poorly understood. Here, we study the conditions under which a social dynamic system is expected to become ideologically sorted as a function of the mechanisms of interaction between its individuals. To this end, we developed and analyzed a multidimensional agent-based model that incorporates two mechanisms: homophily (where people tend to interact with those holding similar opinions) and pairwise-coherence favoritism (where people tend to interact with ingroups holding politically coherent opinions). We numerically integrated the model's master equations that perfectly describe the system's dynamics and found that ideological sorting only emerges in models that include pairwise-coherence favoritism. We then compared the model's outcomes with empirical data from 24,035 opinions across 67 topics and found that pairwise-coherence favoritism is significantly present in datasets that measure political attitudes but absent across topics not considered related to politics.

We show that pluralistic ignorance persists under infrequent imitation and strong initial minority influence. Although individuals can overcome this ignorance by the end of interactions, it reemerges in subsequent meetings.

A common example includes cosponsorship networks, in which legislators are connected indirectly through the bills they support. Yet most existing network models are designed for unipartite networks, where edges can arise between any pair of nodes. However, using a unipartite network model to analyze bipartite networks, as often done in practice, can result in aggregation bias and artificially high-clustering -- a particularly insidious problem when studying the role groups play in network formation. To address these methodological problems, we develop a statistical model of bipartite networks theorized to be generated through group interactions by extending the popular mixed-membership stochastic blockmodel. Our model allows researchers to identify the groups of nodes, within each node type in the bipartite structure, that share common patterns of edge formation. The model also incorporates both node and dyad-level covariates as the predictors of group membership and of observed dyadic relations. We develop an efficient computational algorithm for fitting the model, and apply it to cosponsorship data from the United States Senate. We show that legislators in a Senate that was perfectly split along party lines were able to remain productive and pass major legislation by forming non-partisan, power-brokering coalitions that found common ground through their collaboration on low-stakes bills. We also find evidence for norms of reciprocity, and uncover the substantial role played by policy expertise in the formation of cosponsorships between senators and legislation.

We treat two-node McCulloch-Pitts systems as a minimal complex system. When the link strengths are discretized, $3^4=81$ network models or rules are organized in the rule space The limiting dynamics of each rule may depend on the choice of binary state value ([-1,1] or [0,1]), and on the treatment at the threshold point, leading to at least six variants. One variant with [-1,1] as the binary state value (V1 model) tends to have a more diverse dynamical behaviors with a mixture of multiple cycles and fixed points at the limiting state, whereas other variants tend to fall only to fixed-point limiting dynamics. We use V1 models to study the organization of rules with different dynamics in the rule space and robustness of limiting dynamics with respect to a mutation in the rule table, as well as the related phenomena of phase transition and edge-of-chaos.

Here, we elucidate how day-to-day mobility shapes overall segregation levels, looking at the distinctive segregation experienced by native and foreign-born individuals. Our study is based on ~320,000 smartphone trajectories collected in Sweden, where immigration creates profound divides. We find that while mobility levels generally promote mixing for native-born individuals, foreign-born individuals remain segregated in their out-of-home activities. Using counterfactual simulations, we show that this heterogeneous effect of mobility on experienced segregation results mainly from two mechanisms: homophily and limited travel, i.e., foreign-born individuals (i) prefer destinations visited by similar individuals, and (ii) have limited mobility ranges. We show that homophily plays a minor role, while limited mobility, associated with reduced transport access, limits opportunities for foreign-born to diversify their encounters.

It is usually assumed that only direct interactions, those that form our social network, determine the dynamics of adopting innovations. Here, we put this assumption to the test by experimentally and theoretically studying the role of direct and indirect influences in the adoption of innovations. We perform experiments specifically designed to capture the influence that an individual receives from their direct social ties as well as from those socially close to them, as a function of the separation they have in their social network. The results of 21 experimental sessions with more than 590 participants show that the rate of adoption of an innovation is significantly influenced not only by our nearest neighbors but also by the second and third levels of influences an adopter has. Using a mathematical model that accounts for both direct and indirect interactions in a network, we fit the experimental results and determine the way in which influences decay with social distance. The results indicate that the strength of peer pressure on an adopter coming from its second and third circles of influence is approximately 2/3 and 1/3, respectively, relative to their closest neighbors. Our results strongly suggest that innovation adoption is a complex process in which an individual feels significant pressure not only from their direct ties but also by those socially close to them."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01213": {"title": "EMIF: Evidence-aware Multi-source Information Fusion Network for Explainable Fake News Detection", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01213", "description": "arXiv:2407.01213v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Extensive research on automatic fake news detection has been conducted due to the significant detrimental effects of fake news proliferation.

Inspired by the natural process of fake news identification, we propose an Evidence-aware Multi-source Information Fusion (EMIF) network that jointly leverages user comments and relevant news to make precise decision and excavate reliable evidence. To accomplish this, we initially construct a co-attention network to capture general semantic conflicts between comments and original news. Meanwhile, a divergence selection module is employed to identify the top-K relevant news articles with content that deviates the most from the original news, which ensures the acquisition of multiple evidence with higher objectivity. Finally, we utilize an inconsistency loss function within the evidence fusion layer to strengthen the consistency of two types of evidence, both negating the authenticity of the same news.

Traditionally, this has often been done mainly via the use of text-based approaches, however, recent work has produced a model (CT-TN) that leverages information about a user's social network to help predict their stance, outperforming certain cross-target text-based approaches.

This is done by keeping other relevant network properties (such as power-law degree distribution, number of links, and average degree) unchanged. Monte-Carlo-based simulations are used to compare the convergence rate over many trials of SF graph topologies. Furthermore, to study the convergence rate over real case studies, we compare the clustering coefficient of some real-world networks with the eigenspectrum of the underlying network (as a measure of convergence rate).

We find that systems with high infrastructure and fuel costs should prioritize TPV efficiency, while systems where the TPV cell cost dominates should prioritize power density. We then evaluate how concrete cell improvements could improve the technoeconomics of five example systems, identifying the most impactful specific properties. Namely, improving spectral control with sub-bandgap reflectance is the most effective at reducing LCOE in systems with high infrastructure cost, while increasing view factor and reducing series resistance are most critical in systems with high TPV cell cost.

We find that false news, particularly when accompanied by conspiracy theories, exhibits higher topic diversity than true news. At the news sharer level, false news has a longer lifetime and receives more posts on X than true news. Additionally, the integration of conspiracy theories is significantly associated with a longer lifetime for COVID-19 misinformation. However, topic diversity has no significant association with news sharer engagement in terms of news lifetime and the number of posts. At the post viewer level, contrary to the news sharer level, news posts characterized by heightened topic diversity receive more reposts, likes, and replies. Notably, post viewers tend to engage more with misinformation containing conspiracy narratives: false news posts that contain conspiracy theories, on average, receive 40.8% more reposts, 45.2% more likes, and 44.1% more replies compared to false news posts without conspiracy theories. Our findings suggest that news sharers and post viewers exhibit different engagement patterns on social media regarding topic diversity and conspiracy theories, offering valuable insights into designing targeted misinformation intervention strategies at both user levels."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13054": {"title": "Frustrated Random Walks: A Fast Method to Compute Node Distances on Hypergraphs", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13054", "description": "arXiv:2401.13054v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: A hypergraph is a generalization of a graph that arises naturally when attribute-sharing among entities is considered. Compared to graphs, hypergraphs have the distinct advantage that they contain explicit communities and are more convenient to manipulate. An open problem in hypergraph research is how to accurately and efficiently calculate node distances on hypergraphs. Estimating node distances enables us to find a node's nearest neighbors, which has important applications in such areas as recommender system, targeted ads, etc. In this paper, we propose using expected hitting times of random walks to compute hypergraph node distances. We note that simple random walks (SRW) cannot accurately compute node distances on highly complex real-world hypergraphs, which motivates us to introduce frustrated random walks (FRW) for this task. We further benchmark our method against DeepWalk, and show that while the latter can achieve comparable results, FRW has a distinct computational advantage in cases where the number of targets is fairly small. For such cases, we show that FRW runs in significantly shorter time than DeepWalk. Finally, we analyze the time complexity of our method, and show that for large and sparse hypergraphs, the complexity is approximately linear, rendering it superior to the DeepWalk alternative."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03358": {"title": "A Comprehensive Survey on Graph Reduction: Sparsification, Coarsening, and Condensation", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03358", "description": "arXiv:2402.03358v4 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Many real-world datasets can be naturally represented as graphs, spanning a wide range of domains.

Hypergraphs serve as powerful modeling tools for describing and analyzing the intricate behaviors of systems with multi-body interactions. Herein, we investigate a discrete-time nonlinear averaging dynamics with three-body interactions: an underlying hypergraph, comprising triples as hyperedges, delineates the structure of these interactions, while the vertices update their states through a weighted, state-dependent average of neighboring pairs' states. This dynamics captures reinforcing group effects, such as peer pressure, and exhibits higher-order dynamical effects resulting from a complex interplay between initial states, hypergraph topology, and nonlinearity of the update. Differently from linear averaging dynamics on graphs with two-body interactions, this model does not converge to the average of the initial states but rather induces a shift. By assuming random initial states and by making some regularity and density assumptions on the hypergraph, we prove that the dynamics converges to a multiplicatively-shifted average of the initial states, with high probability.

However, most past and current studies tackled socioeconomic (SE) segregation by analyzing static aggregated mobility networks, often without considering further individual features beyond income and, most importantly, without distinguishing individual-level from location-based income. Accessing individual-level income may help mapping macroscopic behavior into more granular mobility patterns, hence impacting segregation estimates. Here we combine a mobile phone dataset of daily mobility flows across Spanish districts stratified and adjusted by age, gender and income with census data of districts median income. We build mobility-based SE assortativity matrices for multiple demographics and observe mobility patterns of three income groups with respect to location-based SE classes. We find that SE assortativity differs when isolating the mobility of specific income groups: we observe that groups prefer to visit areas with higher average income than their own, which we call preferential mobility. Our analysis suggests substantial differences between weekdays and weekends SE assortativity by age class, with weekends characterized by higher SE assortativity. Our modeling approach shows that the radiation model, which typically performs best at reproducing inter-municipal population mobility, best fits middle income and middle-aged flows, while performing worse on young and low income groups. Our double-sided approach, focusing on assortativity patterns and mobility modeling, suggests that state of the art mobility models fail at capturing preferential mobility behavior. Overall, our work indicates that mobility models considering the interplay of SE preferential behavior, age and gender gaps may sensibly improve the state of the art models performance."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01820": {"title": "Exploring the Role of Randomization on Belief Rigidity in Online Social Networks", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01820", "description": "arXiv:2407.01820v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: People often stick to their existing beliefs, ignoring contradicting evidence or only interacting with those who reinforce their views. Social media platforms often facilitate such tendencies of homophily and echo-chambers as they promote highly personalized content to maximize user engagement. However, increased belief rigidity can negatively affect real-world policy decisions such as leading to climate change inaction and increased vaccine hesitancy. To understand and effectively tackle belief rigidity on online social networks, designing and evaluating various intervention strategies is crucial, and increasing randomization in the network can be considered one such intervention. In this paper, we empirically quantify the effects of a randomized social network structure on belief rigidity, specifically examining the potential benefits of introducing randomness into the network. We show that individuals' beliefs are positively influenced by peer opinions, regardless of whether those opinions are similar to or differ from their own by passively sensing belief rigidity through our experimental framework. Moreover, people incorporate a slightly higher variety of different peers (based on their opinions) into their networks when the recommendation algorithm provides them with diverse content, compared to when it provides them with similar content. Our results indicate that in some cases, there might be benefits to randomization, providing empirical evidence that a more randomized network could be a feasible way of helping people get out of their echo-chambers.

Urban region representation learning emerges as a crucial realm for fulfilling this task. Among deep learning approaches, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise, given that city elements can be naturally represented as nodes with various connections between them as edges. However, many existing GNN approaches encounter challenges such as over-smoothing and limitations in capturing information from nodes in other regions, resulting in the loss of crucial urban information and a decline in region representation performance. To address these challenges, we leverage urban graph structure information and introduce a hierarchical graph pooling process called Coarsened Graph Attention Pooling (CGAP). CGAP features local attention units to create coarsened intermediate graphs and global features. Additionally, by incorporating urban region graphs and global features into a global attention layer, we harness relational information to enhance representation effectiveness. Furthermore, CGAP integrates region attributes such as Points of Interest (POIs) and inter-regional contexts like human mobility, enabling the exploitation of multi-modal urban data for more comprehensive representation learning. Experiments on three downstream tasks related to the UN Sustainable Development Goals validate the effectiveness of region representations learned by our approach.

An important part of this problem is the inherently difficult question of how in a particular situation the privacy of an individual node should be measured. To that end, in this paper we propose a set of aspects that one should consider when choosing a measure for privacy. These aspects include the type of desired privacy and attacker scenario against which the measure protects, utility of the data, the type of desired output, and the computational complexity of the chosen measure. Based on these aspects, we provide a systematic overview of existing approaches in the literature. We then focus on a set of measures that ultimately enables our objective: sharing the anonymized full network dataset with limited disclosure risk. The considered measures, each based on the concept of k-anonymity, account for the structure of the surroundings of a certain node and differ in completeness and reach of the structural information taken into account. We present a comprehensive theoretical characterization as well as comparative empirical experiments on a wide range of real-world network datasets with up to millions of edges. We find that the choice of the measure has an enormous effect on aforementioned aspects. Most interestingly, we find that the most effective measures consider a greater node vicinity, yet utilize minimal structural information and thus use minimal computational resources.

Psychology and Sociology have proposed models of how individuals form opinions and how social interactions influence this process. Socio-Physicists have interpreted patterns in opinion formation as arising from non-linearity in the underlying process, shaping the models. Agent-based modeling has offered a platform to study the Opinion Dynamics of large groups. This paper recasts recent models in opinion formation into a proper dynamical system, injecting the idea of clock time into evolving opinions. The time interval between successive receipts of new information (frequency of information receipts) becomes a factor to study. Social media has shrunk time intervals between information receipts, increasing their frequency. The recast models show that shorter intervals and larger networks increase an individual's propensity for polarization, defined as an inability to hold a neutral opinion. A Polarization number based on sociological parameters is proposed, with critical values beyond which individuals are prone to polarization, depending on psychological parameters. Reduced time intervals and larger interacting groups can push the Polarization number to critical values, contributing to polarization. The Extent of Polarization is defined as the width of the region around neutral within which an individual cannot hold an opinion. Results are reported for model parameters found in the literature.

In this study, we present a simple model of competitive gift-giving that describes how gifts bring goods to the recipient and honor to the donor, and simulate social change. Numerical simulations and an analysis of the corresponding mean-field theory demonstrate the transitions between the following four phases with different distribution shapes of wealth and social reputation: the band, without economic or social disparities; the tribe, with economic but without social disparities; the chiefdom, with both; and the kingdom, with economic disparity and weak social disparity except for an outlier, namely, the ``monarch''. The emergence of strong disparities is characterized by power law distributions and is attributed to the ``rich get richer'' process. In contrast, the absence of such a process leads to exponential distributions due to random fluctuations.

This study investigates strategies to mitigate anti-vaccine social contagion through effective counter-campaigns that disseminate positive vaccine information and encourage vaccine uptake, aiming to reduce the size of epidemics. In a coupled agent-based model that consists of opinion and disease diffusion processes, we explore and compare different heuristics to design positive campaigns based on the network structure and local presence of negative vaccine attitudes. We examine two campaigning regimes: a static regime with a fixed set of targets, and a dynamic regime in which targets can be updated over time. We demonstrate that strategic targeting and engagement with the dynamics of anti-vaccine influence diffusion in the network can effectively mitigate the spread of anti-vaccine sentiment, thereby reducing the epidemic size. However, the effectiveness of the campaigns differs across different targeting strategies and is impacted by a range of factors. We find that the primary advantage of static campaigns lies in their capacity to act as an obstacle, preventing the clustering of emerging anti-vaccine communities, thereby resulting in smaller and unconnected anti-vaccine groups.

To answer this question we compare the online discourse of elected politicians and their constituents. We collect a two and a half years (September 2020 - February 2023) constituency-level dataset for USA and UK that includes: (i) the Twitter timelines (5.6 Million tweets) of elected political representatives (595 UK Members of Parliament and 433 USA Representatives), (ii) the Nextdoor posts (21.8 Million posts) of the constituency (98.4% USA and 91.5% UK constituencies).

The size of the electoral victory and the level of income of a constituency shows a nuanced picture. The narrower the electoral victory, the more similar the style and the more dissimilar the content is. The lower the income of a constituency, the more similar the content is.

If not, we can ask if a small set of edge additions improve information access. Formally, the broadcast value of a network is defined to be the minimum over pairs $u,v \\in V$ of the probability that an information cascade starting at $u$ reaches $v$. Recent work in the algorithmic fairness literature has focused on heuristics for adding a few edges to a graph to improve its broadcast. Our goal is to formally study the approximability of the Broadcast Improvement problem: given $G$ and a parameter $k$, find the best set of $k$ edges to add to $G$ in order to maximize the broadcast value of the resulting graph.\n  We develop efficient bicriteria approximation algorithms. If the optimal solution adds $k$ edges and achieves a broadcast of $\\beta^*$, we develop algorithms that can (a) add $2k-1$ edges and achieve a broadcast value roughly $(\\beta^*)^4$, or (b) add $O(k\\log n)$ edges and achieve a broadcast roughly $\\beta^*$. We also provide other trade-offs, that can be better depending on $k$ and the parameter associated with propagation in the cascade model. We complement our results by proving that unless P = NP, any algorithm that adds $O(k)$ edges must lose significantly in the approximation of $\\beta^*$, resolving an open question.\n  Our techniques are inspired by connections between Broadcast Improvement and problems such as Metric $k$-Center and Diameter Reduction. However, since the objective involves information cascades, we need to develop novel probabilistic tools to reason about the existence of paths in edge-sampled graphs.

The message-passing paradigm and the global attention mechanism fundamentally generate node embeddings based on information aggregated from a node's local neighborhood or from the whole graph. The most basic and commonly used aggregation approach is to take the sum of information from a node's local neighbourhood or from the whole graph. However, it is unknown if the dominant information is from a node itself or from the node's neighbours (or the rest of the graph nodes). Therefore, there exists information lost at each layer of embedding generation, and this information lost could be accumulated and become more serious when more layers are used in the model. In this paper, we present a differential encoding method to address the issue of information lost. The idea of our method is to encode the differential representation between the information from a node's neighbours (or the rest of the graph nodes) and that from the node itself. The obtained differential encoding is then combined with the original aggregated local or global representation to generate the updated node embedding. By integrating differential encodings, the representational ability of generated node embeddings is improved. The differential encoding method is empirically evaluated on different graph tasks on seven benchmark datasets.

We introduce a general and flexible compartmental model to study the effect of heterogeneity in the population with regards to risk tolerance. The interplay between behavior and epidemiology leads to a rich set of possible epidemic dynamics. Depending on the behavioral composition of the population, we find that increasing heterogeneity in risk tolerance can either increase or decrease the epidemic size. We find that multiple waves of infection can arise due to the interplay between transmission and behavior, even without the replenishment of susceptibles. We find that increasing protective mechanisms such as the effectiveness of interventions, the number of risk-averse people in the population, and the duration of intervention usage reduces the epidemic overshoot. When the protection is pushed past a critical threshold, the epidemic dynamics enter an underdamped regime where the epidemic size exactly equals the herd immunity threshold. Lastly, we can find regimes where epidemic size does not monotonically decrease with a population that becomes increasingly risk-averse."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03388": {"title": "Passenger Route and Departure Time Guidance under Disruptions in Oversaturated Urban Rail Transit Networks", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03388", "description": "arXiv:2407.03388v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The urban rail transit (URT) system attracts many commuters with its punctuality and convenience. However, it is vulnerable to disruptions caused by factors like extreme weather and temporary equipment failures, which greatly impact passengers' journeys and diminish the system's service quality. In this study, we propose targeted travel guidance for passengers at different space-time locations by devising passenger rescheduling strategies during disruptions. This guidance not only offers insights into route changes but also provides practical recommendations for delaying departure times when required. We present a novel three-feature four-group passenger classification principle, integrating temporal, spatial, and spatio-temporal features to classify passengers in disrupted URT networks. This approach results in the creation of four distinct solution spaces based on passenger groups. A mixed integer programming model is built based on individual level considering the First-in-First-out (FIFO) rule in oversaturated networks. Additionally, we present a two-stage solution approach for handling the complex issues in large-scale networks. Experimental results from both small-scale artificial networks and the real-world Beijing URT network validate the efficacy of our proposed passenger rescheduling strategies in mitigating disruptions. Specifically, when compared to scenarios with no travel guidance during disruptions, our strategies achieve a substantial reduction in total passenger travel time by 29.7% and 50.9% respectively, underscoring the effectiveness in managing unexpected disruptions."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03484": {"title": "Visualizing the Evolution of Twitter (X", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03484", "description": "arXiv:2407.03484v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: With the rise of social media platforms, especially X.com (formerly Twitter), there is a growing interest in understanding digital social networks and human digital interactions.

Many psychological studies have observed that personalities are strongly reflected in their social behaviors and social environments. In light of these problems, this paper proposes a sociological analysis framework for one's personality in an environment-based view instead of individual-level data mining. Specifically, to comprehensively understand an individual's behavior from low-quality records, we leverage the powerful associative ability of LLMs by designing an effective prompt. In this way, LLMs can integrate various scattered information with their external knowledge to generate higher-quality profiles, which can significantly improve the personality analysis performance. To explore the interactive mechanism behind the users and their online environments, we design an effective hypergraph neural network where the hypergraph nodes are users and the hyperedges in the hypergraph are social environments. We offer a useful dataset with user profile data, personality traits, and several detected environments from the real-world social platform. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first network-based dataset containing both hypergraph structure and social information, which could push forward future research in this area further.

Institutions of higher education are often targets of autocrats who seek to suppress intellectual sources of social and political resistance. At the same time, international collaboration in scientific research has reached an all-time high, and the network of global science grows larger and denser every year. This research analyzes the effects of academic freedom on international research collaboration (IRC) among a sample of 166 countries. Global international collaboration data are drawn from articles in Web of Science across a 33-year time frame (1993-2022) and used to construct three separate IRC networks in science and technology (S&amp;T), social sciences (SocSci), and arts and humanities (A&amp;H). The Academic Freedom Index, covering the same time frame, is drawn from the Varieties of Democracy Project. Stochastic actor-oriented models (SAOM) are used to analyze the networks, implemented using the R package RSiena. Since IRC networks are naturally weighted by frequency of international co-authorship instances for each year, the R package backbone is used to binarize and trim the ties. Numerous endogenous network control variables are included in the model, as are exogenous country level factors, including geographic distance, number of authors, and GDP. The results show positive significant estimates for direct effects, non-linear direct effects, and homophily effects of academic freedom on tie creation and maintenance over time.

While significant research has examined individual LLM behaviors, existing studies have largely overlooked the collective behaviors and information distortions arising from iterated LLM interactions. Small biases, negligible at the single output level, risk being amplified in iterated interactions, potentially leading the content to evolve towards attractor states. In a series of telephone game experiments, we apply a transmission chain design borrowed from the human cultural evolution literature: LLM agents iteratively receive, produce, and transmit texts from the previous to the next agent in the chain. By tracking the evolution of text toxicity, positivity, difficulty, and length across transmission chains, we uncover the existence of biases and attractors, and study their dependence on the initial text, the instructions, language model, and model size. For instance, we find that more open-ended instructions lead to stronger attraction effects compared to more constrained tasks. We also find that different text properties display different sensitivity to attraction effects, with toxicity leading to stronger attractors than length.

We leverage a new analytic solution to obtain, (1) a simple relationship between rational social distancing behaviour and the current number of infections; (2) new scaling results for how the infection peak and number of total cases depend on the cost of contracting the disease; (3) characteristic infection costs that divide regimes of strong and weak behavioural response and depend only on the basic reproduction number of the disease; (4) a closed form expression for the value of the utility.

We identify two competing mechanisms driving disease-induced herd immunity in networks: the high density of immunity among socially active individuals enhances the herd immunity effect, while the topological localization of immune individuals weakens it. The effect of localization is stronger in networks embedded in low-dimensional space, which can make disease-induced immunity less effective than random immunization.

It is widely believed that contact interactions among individual entities play an essential role in the spreading process. Although contact interactions are often influenced by geometrical conditions, little attention has been paid to understand their effects, especially on contact duration among pedestrians. To examine how the pedestrian flow setups affect contact duration distribution, we have analyzed trajectories of pedestrians in contact interactions collected from pedestrian flow experiments of uni-, bi- and multi-directional setups. Based on turning angle entropy and efficiency, we have classified the type of motion observed in the contact interactions. We have found that the majority of contact interactions in the unidirectional flow setup can be categorized as confined motion, hinting at the possibility of long-lived contact duration. However, ballistic motion is more frequently observed in the other flow conditions, yielding frequent, brief contact interactions. Our results demonstrate that observing more confined motions is likely associated with the increase of parallel contact interactions regardless of pedestrian flow setups. This study highlights that the confined motions tend to yield longer contact duration, suggesting that the infectious disease transmission risk would be considerable even for low transmissibility.

To enable its widespread use, H2 supply chain (HSC) infrastructure is required. Mature and economically viable low-carbon H2 production pathways include steam methane reforming (SMR) of natural gas coupled with carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS), water-electrolysis from renewable electricity, biomethane reforming, and biomass gasification. However, uncertainties surrounding demand and feedstock availabilities hamper their proliferation. Here, we investigate the impact of uncertainty in H2 demand and biomass availability on the optimal HSC design. The HSC is modeled as a network of H2 production and consumption sites that are interconnected with H2 and biomass transport technologies. A CCS supply chain is modeled alongside the HSC. The cost-optimal HSC design is determined based on a linear optimization problem that considers a regional resolution and a multi-year time horizon (2022-2050). We adopt a scenario-based uncertainty quantification approach and define discrete H2 demand and biomass availability scenarios. Applying a minimum-regret strategy, we show that sufficiently large low-carbon H2 production capacities (about 9.6 Mt/a by 2030) are essential to flexibly scale up HSCs and accommodate H2 demands of up to 35 Mt/a by 2050. While biomass-based H2 production emerges as the most cost-efficient low-carbon H2 production pathway, investments are not recommended unless the availability of biomass feedstocks is guaranteed. Instead, investments in SMR-CCS and electrolysis often offer greater flexibility.

Notably, for natives, network exposure shows a shift from positive to negative association with perceptions of immigration beyond a certain exposure threshold. The multi-layer nature of our data highlights this tipping point for next-door neighbors, with private social contexts exhibiting a positive relationship between exposure and immigration perceptions. Furthermore, it shows that contacts spanning multiple contexts also strengthen this relationship.

However, existing works mainly adopt a single-branch fusion structure that primarily captures the consistent sentiment between image and text. The ignorance or implicit modeling of discrepant sentiment results in compromised unimodal encoding and limited performances. In this paper, we propose a semantics Completion and Decomposition (CoDe) network to resolve the above issue. In the semantics completion module, we complement image and text representations with the semantics of the OCR text embedded in the image, helping bridge the sentiment gap. In the semantics decomposition module, we decompose image and text representations with exclusive projection and contrastive learning, thereby explicitly capturing the discrepant sentiment between modalities. Finally, we fuse image and text representations by cross-attention and combine them with the learned discrepant sentiment for final classification.

The former is known to enhance the stability of communities, while the latter is related to their feasibility, albeit compromising the stability. However, it has recently been shown that the joint emergence of these structures poses challenges that can eventually lead to limitations in the dynamic properties of mutualistic communities. We hypothesize that considering compound arrangements -- modules with internal nested organization -- can offer valuable insights in this debate. We analyze the temporal structural dynamics of 20 plant-pollinator interaction networks and observe large structural variability throughout the year. Compound structures are particularly prevalent during the peak of the pollination season, often coexisting with nested and modular arrangements in varying degrees. Motivated by these empirical findings, we synthetically investigate the dynamics of the structural patterns across two control parameters -- community size and connectance levels -- mimicking the progression of the pollination season. Our analysis reveals contrasting impacts on the stability and feasibility of these mutualistic communities. We characterize the consistent relationship between network structure and stability, which follows a monotonic pattern. But, in terms of feasibility, we observe non-linear relationships. Compound structures exhibit a favorable balance between stability and feasibility, particularly in mid-sized ecological communities, suggesting they may effectively navigate the simultaneous requirements of stability and feasibility.

To fill this gap, we focus on signed, directed connections, with the aim of exploring the notion of frustration in such a context. When dealing with signed, directed edges, frustration is a multi-faceted concept, admitting different definitions at different scales: if we limit ourselves to consider cycles of length two, frustration is related to reciprocity, i.e. the tendency of edges to admit the presence of partners pointing in the opposite direction. As the reciprocity of signed networks is still poorly understood, we adopt a principled approach for its study, defining quantities and introducing models to consistently capture empirical patterns of the kind. In order to quantify the tendency of empirical networks to form either mutualistic or antagonistic cycles of length two, we extend the Exponential Random Graphs framework to binary, directed, signed networks with global and local constraints and, then, compare the empirical abundance of the aforementioned patterns with the one expected under each model. We find that the (directed extension of the) balance theory is not capable of providing a consistent explanation of the patterns characterising the directed, signed networks considered in this work. Although part of the ambiguities can be solved by adopting a coarser definition of balance, our results call for a different theory, accounting for the directionality of edges in a coherent manner. In any case, the evidence that the empirical, signed networks can be highly reciprocated leads us to recommend to explicitly account for the role played by bidirectional dyads in determining frustration at higher levels (e.g. the triadic one)."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07925": {"title": "Enhancing Social Media Personalization: Dynamic User Profile Embeddings and Multimodal Contextual Analysis Using Transformer Models", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07925", "description": "arXiv:2407.07925v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: This study investigates the impact of dynamic user profile embedding on personalized context-aware experiences in social networks.

Therefore, the model does not have the conservation of the active particles composed of susceptible and infected individuals. The reaction-diffusion dynamics are separated into two stages: (i) Brownian diffusion, where the particles can jump to neighboring nodes, and (ii) contamination and recovery reactions. The dynamics are mapped into a growing process by activating lattice nodes with successful contaminations where activated nodes are interpreted as infection sources. In all simulations, the epidemic starts with one infected individual in a lattice filled with susceptibles.

Earlier studies focus primarily on random networks without spatial constraints and reveal intriguing mixed-order transitions. However, real-world systems, ranging from transportation and communication networks to complex brain networks, are not random but are spatially embedded. Here, we study k-core percolation on two-dimensional spatially embedded networks and show that, in contrast to regular percolation, the length of connections can control the transition type, leading to four different types of phase transitions associated with novel phenomena and a rich phase diagram. A key finding is the existence of a metastable phase in which microscopic localized damage, independent of system size, can cause a macroscopic phase transition, a result which cannot be achieved in traditional percolation. In this case, local failures can spontaneously propagate the damage radially until the system entirely collapses, a phenomenon analogous to the nucleation process. These findings suggest novel features and extreme vulnerabilities of spatially embedded k-core network systems, and highlight the necessity to take into account the characteristic length of links when designing robust spatial networks.

These dynamics on networked populations (individuals occupying nodes of a graph) are mainly concerning on the competition between to cooperate or to defect, by allowing some process of revision of strategies. Cooperators avoid defectors by forming clusters in a process known as network reciprocity. This defense strategy is based on the fact that any individual interact only with its nearest neighbors. The minimum cluster, in turn, is formed by a set of three completely connected nodes and the bulk of these triplets is associated with the transitivity property of a network. Particularly, we show that the transitivity increases eventually assuming a constant behavior when observed as a function of the number of contacts of an individual. We investigate the influence of the network reciprocity on that transitivity increasing regime on the promotion of a cooperative behavior. The dynamics on small-world networks are compared with those random regular, and annealed networks, the later typically studied as the well-mixed approach.

One form of diversity of recent interest is calibration, the notion that personalized recommendations should reflect the full distribution of a user's interests, rather than a single predominant category -- for instance, a user who mainly reads entertainment news but also wants to keep up with news on the environment and the economy would prefer to see a mixture of these genres, not solely entertainment news. Existing work has formulated calibration as a subset selection problem; this line of work observes that the formulation requires the unrealistic assumption that all recommended items receive equal consideration from the user, but leaves as an open question the more realistic setting in which user attention decays as they move down the list of results.\n  In this paper, we consider calibration with decaying user attention under two different models. In both models, there is a set of underlying genres that items can belong to. In the first setting, where items are represented by fine-grained mixtures of genre percentages, we provide a $(1-1/e)$-approximation algorithm by extending techniques for constrained submodular optimization.

However, it is challenging to apply them to practical situations, especially when using the trained propagation-based models to detect news with no propagation data. Towards this scenario, we study a new task named cold-start fake news detection, which aims to detect content-only samples with missing propagation. To achieve the task, we design a simple but effective Structure Adversarial Net (SAN) framework to learn transferable features from available propagation to boost the detection of content-only samples. SAN introduces a structure discriminator to estimate dissimilarities among learned features with and without propagation, and further learns structure-invariant features to enhance the generalization of existing propagation-based methods for content-only samples.

We derive inequalities expressing when such structures can be detected under the configuration model. Nestedness is closely related to core-periphery and is similarly restricted to only be detectable under certain conditions. We show that these conditions are a generalisation of the resolution limit to structures other than assortative communities.

Kinship structures in traditional societies provide a fundamental illustration, where cultural rules between clans determine people's marriage possibilities. Here we propose a simple model of kinship interactions that considers kin and in-law cooperation and sexual rivalry. In this model, multiple societies compete. Societies consist of multiple families with different cultural traits and mating preferences. These values determine interactions and hence the growth rate of families and are transmitted to offspring with mutations. Through a multilevel evolutionary simulation, family traits and preferences are grouped into multiple clans with inter-clan mating preferences. It illustrates the emergence of kinship structures as the spontaneous formation of interdependent cultural associations. Emergent kinship structures are characterized by the cycle length of marriage exchange and the number of cycles in society. We numerically and analytically clarify their parameter dependence. The relative importance of cooperation versus rivalry determines whether attraction or repulsion exists between families. Different structures evolve as locally stable attractors. The probabilities of formation and collapse of complex structures depend on the number of families and the mutation rate, showing characteristic scaling relationships. It is now possible to explore macroscopic kinship structures based on microscopic interactions, together with their environmental dependence and the historical causality of their evolution. We propose the basic causal mechanism of the formation of typical human social structures by referring to ethnographic observations and concepts from statistical physics and multilevel evolution.

Cryptocurrencies are characterised by high market volatility and susceptibility to substantial crashes, issues that require temporal analysis methodologies able to tackle the high temporal resolution, heterogeneity and scale of blockchain data. While existing research attempts to analyse crash events, fundamental questions persist regarding the optimal time scale for analysis, differentiation between long-term and short-term trends, and the identification and characterisation of shock events within these decentralised systems. This paper addresses these issues by examining cryptocurrencies traded on the Ethereum blockchain, with a spotlight on the crash of the stablecoin TerraUSD and the currency LUNA designed to stabilise it. Utilising complex network analysis and a multi-layer temporal graph allows the study of the correlations between the layers representing the currencies and system evolution across diverse time scales. The investigation sheds light on the strong interconnections among stablecoins pre-crash and the significant post-crash transformations.

We use a hybrid pipeline to detect and analyze vaccination-related tweets using topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and a minimum of social scientific domain knowledge to analyze the discourse about vaccinations in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic in the DACH region. We show that skepticism regarding the severity of the COVID-19 virus and towards efficacy and safety of vaccines were among the prevalent topics in the discourse on Twitter but that the most attention was given to debating the theme of freedom and civic liberties. Especially during later phases of the pandemic, when implemented policies restricted the freedom of unvaccinated citizens, increased vaccination uptake could be observed.

In general, NSUM assumes that the social network topology and the hidden sub-population distribution are well-behaved; hence, the NSUM estimate is close to the actual value. However, bounds on NSUM estimation errors have not been analytically proven. This paper provides analytical bounds on the error incurred by the two most popular NSUM estimators. These bounds assume that the queried nodes accurately provide their degree and the number of neighbors belonging to the hidden population. Our key findings are twofold.

The thematic analysis goes beyond traditional topic-level analysis, which often captures only the broadest patterns, providing deeper insights into specific and actionable themes such as \"public sentiment towards vaccination\", \"political discourse surrounding climate policies,\" etc. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to uncovering latent themes in social media messaging.

Traditional theme discovery methods typically involve manual processes and a human-in-the-loop approach. While valuable, these methods face challenges in scalability, consistency, and resource intensity in terms of time and cost. To address these challenges, we propose a machine-in-the-loop approach that leverages the advanced capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).

While sparsity is common in practice, in some applications one faces the opposite situation of a very dense network, where only $O(n)$ potential edges are missing with respect to a complete graph. We explain why and how, even for very dense networks, it is possible to efficiently compute the ranking stemming from Katz centrality for unweighted graphs, possibly directed and possibly with loops, by working on the complement graph. Our approach also provides an interpretation, regardless of sparsity, of \"Katz centrality with negative parameter\" as usual Katz centrality on the complement graph.

As these communities grow, a key question arises: how does the need for regulatory functions scale? Do larger groups require more regulatory actions and oversight per person, or can they manage with less? Our analysis of Reddit's regulatory functions reveals robust scaling relationships across different subreddits, suggesting universal patterns between community size and the amount of regulation needed. We found that the number of comments and moderator actions, such as comment removals, grew faster than the community size, with superlinear exponents of 1.12 and 1.18, respectively. However, bot-based rule enforcement did not keep pace with community growth, exhibiting a slightly sublinear exponent of 0.95. Further analysis of the residuals from these scaling behaviors identified a 'trade-off axis,' where one-way coordination mechanisms (bots and moderators) counteract two-way interactions (comments) and vice versa.

Using GPS location data, we identify four distinct patterns of experienced segregation across US cities. Most common are affluent or poor neighborhoods where visitors lack diversity and residents have limited exposure to diversity elsewhere. Less frequent are majority-minority areas where residents must travel for diverse encounters, and wealthy urban zones with diverse visitors but where locals sort into homogeneous amenities. By clustering areas with similar mobility signatures, we uncover rings around cities and internal pockets where intergroup interaction is limited. Using a decision tree, we show that demography and location interact to create these zones.

However, little attention has been given to understanding how individual characteristics relate to social behavior. This is particularly important in younger age groups due to its potential effects on early childhood development. In this study, conducted during the Complexity 72h Workshop, we analyze human social interactions in a French preschool, where children's face-to-face interactions were monitored using proximity sensors over an academic year. We use metadata from parent surveys and preschool linguistic tests, covering demographic information and home habits, to examine the interplay between individual characteristics and contact patterns. Using a mixture of approaches, from random forest classifiers to network-based metrics at both dyadic and higher-order (group) levels, we identify sex, age, language scores, and number of siblings as the variables displaying the most significant associations with interaction patterns. We explore these variables' relationships to interactions within and outside classrooms and across mixed and single-grade classes. At the group level, we investigate how group affinity affects group persistence. We also find that higher-order network centrality (hypercoreness) is higher among children with siblings, indicating different group embedding despite similar total contact duration. This study aligns with existing literature on early social development and highlights the importance of integrating individual traits into the study of human interactions.

In order to move towards a more integrated view of cascades, this paper offers the first comprehensive investigation into the role of two social factors in the diffusion of 1,337 popular hashtags representing the production of novel culture on Twitter: 1) the topology of the Twitter social network and 2) performance of each user's probable demographic identity. Here, we show that cascades are best modeled using a combination of network and identity, rather than either factor alone. This combined model best reproduces a composite index of ten cascade properties across all 1,337 hashtags. However, there is important heterogeneity in what social factors are required to reproduce different properties of hashtag cascades. For instance, while a combined network+identity model best predicts the popularity of cascades, a network-only model has better performance in predicting cascade growth and an identity-only model in adopter composition. We are able to predict what type of hashtag is best modeled by each combination of features and use this to further improve performance. Additionally, consistent with prior literature on the combined network+identity model most outperforms the single-factor counterfactuals among hashtags used for expressing racial or regional identity, stance-taking, talking about sports, or variants of existing cultural trends with very slow- or fast-growing communicative need. In sum, our results imply the utility of multi-factor models in predicting cascades, in order to account for the varied ways in which network, identity, and other social factors play a role in the diffusion of hashtags on Twitter."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12112": {"title": "A Benchmark for Fairness-Aware Graph Learning", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12112", "description": "arXiv:2407.12112v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Fairness-aware graph learning has gained increasing attention in recent years.

In this paper, we introduce Unified Temporal Graph (UTG), a framework that unifies snapshot-based and event-based machine learning models under a single umbrella, enabling models developed for one representation to be applied effectively to datasets of the other.

Our main findings are threefold: first, when combined with UTG training, snapshotbased models can perform competitively with event-based models such as TGN and GraphMixer even on event datasets. Second, snapshot-based models are at least an order of magnitude faster than most event-based models during inference. Third, while event-based methods such as NAT and DyGFormer outperforms snapshotbased methods on both types of temporal graphs, this is because they leverage joint neighborhood structural features thus emphasizing the potential to incorporate these features into snapshot-based models as well.

Our findings reveal that local information can effectively contain an epidemic, even with only a small proportion of individuals opting for self-quarantine.

In contrast, the releasing pattern under the local information appears to be more random. This shaking phenomenon can be observed in various types of networks associated with different characteristics.

However, there is a general lack of quantitative methods for investigating examinations. To address this gap, we propose a new metric via complex networks; i.e., the knowledge point network (KPN) of an examination is constructed by representing the knowledge points (concepts, laws, etc.) as nodes and adding links when these points appear in the same question. Then, the topological quantities of KPNs, such as degree, centrality, and community, can be employed to systematically explore the structural properties and evolution of examinations. In this work, 35 physics examinations from the NCEE examination spanning from 2006 to 2020 were investigated as an evidence. We found that the constructed KPNs are scale-free networks that show strong assortativity and small-world effects in most cases.

Different question types are related to specific knowledge points, leading to noticeable structural variations in KPNs.

To improve detection performance, counterfactual graphs have been exploited to benefit the generalization capacity by learning causal relations. Most existing studies directly introduce perturbations (e.g., flipping edges) to generate counterfactual graphs, which are prone to alter the semantics of generated examples and make them off the data manifold, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach, Motif-consistent Counterfactuals with Adversarial Refinement (MotifCAR), for graph-level anomaly detection. The model combines the motif of one graph, the core subgraph containing the identification (category) information, and the contextual subgraph (non-motif) of another graph to produce a raw counterfactual graph. However, the produced raw graph might be distorted and cannot satisfy the important counterfactual properties: Realism, Validity, Proximity and Sparsity. Towards that, we present a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based graph optimizer to refine the raw counterfactual graphs. It adopts the discriminator to guide the generator to generate graphs close to realistic data, i.e., meet the property Realism. Further, we design the motif consistency to force the motif of the generated graphs to be consistent with the realistic graphs, meeting the property Validity. Also, we devise the contextual loss and connection loss to control the contextual subgraph and the newly added links to meet the properties Proximity and Sparsity.

This inevitably induces the inherent human characteristic that there are subjective interaction preferences for different groups, especially in human-agent hybrid systems where human-human interaction, agent-agent interaction, and human-agent interaction coexist. However, understanding how individual interaction preferences affect the cooperation of the system remains a major challenge. Therefore, this paper proposes a human-agent hybrid prisoner's dilemma game system under the framework of evolutionary game. In spatial networks, the most significant difference between agents and humans is the flexibility of decision, where humans have higher adaptive capabilities, follow link dynamics, and adopt free decision rules, which enable them to choose different strategies for different neighbors. However, agents follow node dynamics and adopt consistent decision rules, applying the same strategy to different neighbors. We give the subjective preferences of any individual to different groups, involving the interaction preferences between homogeneous groups and heterogeneous groups respectively. The simulation results show that both human and agent have asymmetric interaction preferences for groups with different identities, which can significantly improve the cooperative behavior of the system.

Increasingly, modellers look at Modelling to generate alternatives (MGA) as a way to go beyond few, optimal designs and provide stakeholders with broad portfolios of design options to appraise based on their preferences and knowledge of the problem. In practice, however, generating and exploring all the feasible system design options is not computationally possible. Modellers need to choose what design feature to generate diversity around, and yet, they cannot know what features may matter the most to heterogeneous real-world stakeholders. Stakeholders' knowledge is thus needed to guide the MGA search towards the most important trade-offs, but how to incorporate such knowledge in the MGA workflow is unclear.

In contrast to recent approaches that transfer the entire knowledge from the unsupervised model to the supervised one, we argue that an effective transfer should only retain the relevant semantics that align well with the supervised task.

We consider in particular hypergraphs with higher-order triadic interactions that can upregulate or downregulate the hyperedges. Triadic interactions are a general type of signed regulatory interaction that occurs when a third node regulates the interaction between two other nodes. For example, in brain networks, the glia can facilitate or inhibit synaptic interactions between neurons. However, the regulatory interactions may not only occur between regulator nodes and pairwise interactions but also between regulator nodes and higher-order interactions (hyperedges), leading to higher-order triadic interactions. For instance, in biochemical reaction networks, the enzymes regulate the reactions involving multiple reactants. Here we propose and investigate higher-order triadic percolation on hypergraphs showing that the giant component can have a non-trivial dynamics. Specifically, we demonstrate that, under suitable conditions, the order parameter of this percolation problem, i.e., the fraction of nodes in the giant component, undergoes a route to chaos in the universality class of the logistic map. In hierarchical higher-order triadic percolation, we extend this paradigm in order to treat hierarchically nested triadic interactions demonstrating the non-trivial effect of their increased combinatorial complexity on the critical phenomena and the dynamical properties of the process.

For the fully connected complete graph, the homogeneous mixing condition enables us to use mean-field theory to analyze the opinion evolution of the system. However, when the number of opinions increases, the number of variables describing the system grows exponentially. To mitigate this, we focus on a special scenario where the largest group of committed agents competes with a motley of committed groups, each of which is smaller than the largest one, while initially, most of uncommitted agents hold one unique opinion. This scenario is chosen for its recurrence in diverse societies and its potential for complexity reduction by unifying agents from smaller committed groups into one category. Our investigation reveals that when the size of the largest committed group reaches the critical threshold, most of uncommitted agents change their beliefs to this opinion, triggering a phase transition.

Despite their safety-oriented nature, when calibrating and evaluating these models, the main objective of most studies is to find model parameters that minimize the error in observed measurements like spacing and speed while studies specifically focused on calibrating and evaluating unobserved safe behavior captured by the parameters of the model are scarce. Most studies on calibration and evaluation of the IDM do not check if the observed driving behavior (i.e. spacing) are within the model estimated unobserved safety thresholds (i.e. desired safety spacing) or what parameters are important for safety. This limits their application for safety driven traffic simulations. To fill this gap, this paper first proposes a simple metric to evaluate driver compliance with the safety thresholds of the IDM model.

Next, a method to enforce compliance to the safety threshold during model calibration is proposed. The proposed compliance metric and the calibration approach is tested using Dutch highway trajectory data obtained from a driving simulator experiment and two drones.

Our motivation for this review is twofold. First, the frequency and magnitude of natural and man-made disasters (e.g., wild fires, tornadoes, global pandemics, terrorist attacks) have been increasing. These events disrupt the operation of infrastructure networks, preventing the delivery of vital goods and services such as power and food. Therefore, it is critical to understand the state-of-the-art in responding to network disruptions in order to develop efficient strategies to mitigate their impacts. Second, it is critical to enable timely decisions in a rapidly changing and unpredictable environment while accounting for numerous interrelated factors. Because the vast majority of response decision problems are computationally challenging, quickly finding solutions that are compatible with real-time decision making is a difficult task. Hence, it is important to understand the nature of response activities and decisions, as well as the available solution methodologies and inherent trade-offs between computation time and solution quality.

A recent advancement in this field is the development of a methodology that transforms census population count-by-race data into a grid of monoracial cells. This format enables assessment of heterogeneity of segregation within a city. This paper leverages such a grid for the quantification of race-constrained population patterns, allowing for the calculation and mapping of binary segregation patterns within arbitrary region. A key innovation is the application of Multifractal Analysis (MFA) to quantify the residency patterns of race-constrained populations. The residency pattern is characterized by a multifractal spectrum function, where the independent variable is a local metric of pattern's \"gappiness\", and the dependent variable is proportional to the size of the sub-pattern consisting of all locations having the same value of this metric. In the context of binary populations, the gappiness of the race-constrained population's pattern is intrinsically linked to its segregation. This paper provides a comprehensive description of the methodology, illustrated with examples focusing on the residency pattern of Black population in the central region of Washington, DC. Further, the methodology is demonstrated using a sample of residency patterns of Black population in fourteen large U.S. cities. By numerically describing each pattern through a multifractal spectrum, the fourteen patterns are clustered into three distinct categories, each having unique characteristics. Maps of local gappiness and segregation for each city are provided to show the connection between the nature of the multifractal spectrum and the corresponding residency and segregation patterns.

To address this, we propose a Digital Twin-based Driver Risk-Aware Intelligent Mobility Analytics (DT-DIMA) system. The DT-DIMA system integrates real-time traffic information from pan-tilt-cameras (PTCs), synchronizes this data into a digital twin to accurately replicate the physical world, and predicts network-wide mobility and safety risks in real time. The system's innovation lies in its integration of spatial-temporal modeling, simulation, and online control modules. Tested and evaluated under normal traffic conditions and incidental situations (e.g., unexpected accidents, pre-planned work zones) in a simulated testbed in Brooklyn, New York, DT-DIMA demonstrated mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) ranging from 8.40% to 15.11% in estimating network-level traffic volume and MAPEs from 0.85% to 12.97% in network-level safety risk prediction. In addition, the highly accurate safety risk prediction enables PTCs to preemptively monitor road segments with high driving risks before incidents take place. Such proactive PTC surveillance creates around a 5-minute lead time in capturing traffic incidents. The DT-DIMA system enables transportation managers to understand mobility not only in terms of traffic patterns but also driver-experienced safety risks, allowing for proactive resource allocation in response to various traffic situations.

However, scalability remains a major challenge in both supervised and unsupervised learning for large graphs (e.g., those with over 1 billion nodes). The scalability bottleneck largely stems from the mini-batch sampling phase in GNNs and the random walk sampling phase in unsupervised methods. These processes often require storing features or embeddings in memory. In the context of distributed training, they require frequent, inefficient random access to data stored across different workers. Such repeated inter-worker communication for each mini-batch leads to high communication overhead and computational inefficiency.\n  We propose GraphScale, a unified framework for both supervised and unsupervised learning to store and process large graph data distributedly.

In this article, we answer this question for homophily-driven patterns in social media. In our previous studies, we found that, on a university campus, changes in student opinions were driven by the desire to hold popular opinions. Here, we demonstrate that the evolution of online platform-wide opinion groups is driven by the same desire. We focus on two social media: Twitter and Parler, on which we tracked the political biases of their users. On Parler, an initially stable group of Right-biased users evolved into a permanent Right-leaning echo chamber dominating weaker, transient groups of members with opposing political biases. In contrast, on Twitter, the initial presence of two large opposing bias groups led to the evolution of a bimodal bias distribution, with a high degree of polarization. We capture the movement of users from the initial to final bias groups during the tracking period. We also show that user choices are influenced by side-effects of homophily. Users entering the platform attempt to find a sufficiently large group whose members hold political biases within the range sufficiently close to their own. If successful, they stabilize their biases and become permanent members of the group. Otherwise, they leave the platform.

Recently, community search in heterogeneous information networks (HINs) has received considerable attention. Existing methods typically focus on modeling relationships in HINs through predefined meta-paths or user-specified relational constraints. However, metapath-based methods are primarily designed to identify single-type communities with nodes of the same type rather than multi-type communities involving nodes of different types. Constraint-based methods require users to have a good understanding of community patterns to define a suitable set of relational constraints, which increases the burden on users.

We introduce a new agent-based model that simultaneously considers talent, luck, and social interaction. This model allows us to explore how network structure (how agents interact) and talent distribution among agents affect the dynamics of capital accumulation through analytical and numerical methods. We identify a phenomenon as ``talent configuration effect\", which refers to the influence of how talent is allocated to individuals (nodes) in the network. We analyze this effect through two key properties: talent assortativity (TA) and talent-degree correlation (TD). In particular, we focus on three economic indicators: growth rate ($n_{\\rm rate}$), Gini coefficient (inequality: $n_{\\rm Gini}$), and meritocratic fairness ($n_{LT}$). This investigation helps us understand the interplay between talent configuration and network structure on capital dynamics. We find that, in the short term, positive correlations exist between TA and TD for all three economic indicators. Furthermore, the dominant factor influencing capital dynamics depends on the network topology. In scale-free networks, TD has a stronger influence on the economic indices than TA. Conversely, in lattice-like networks, TA plays a more significant role.

We propose a modelling framework that combines two different generalisations of the power law, namely the generalised Pareto distribution and the Zipf-polylog distribution, to resolve these issues.

For definiteness, we consider a game where $N$ players bet on the binary outcome of a stochastic process and share the entry fees pot if successful. We assume that one player holds information about past outcomes of the game, which they may either use exclusively to improve their betting strategy or offer to sell to another player.

It obviates the need for expensive iterative training of the sort required by deep learning methods. Specifically, we propose a Hyperdimensional Graph Learning (HDGL) algorithm. HDGL leverages the \\emph{injectivity} property of node representations of a family of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to map node features to the HD space and then uses HD operators such as bundling and binding to aggregate information from the local neighborhood of each node. The resulting latent node representations support both node classification and link prediction tasks, unlike typical deep learning methods, which often require separate models for these tasks.\n  We report results of experiments using widely used benchmark datasets which demonstrate that, on the node classification task, HDGL is competitive with the SOTA GNN methods with respect to accuracy, at substantially reduced computational cost. Furthermore, HDGL is well-suited for class incremental learning where the model has to learn to effectively discriminate between a growing number of classes. Our experiments also show that the HD representation constructed by HDGL supports link prediction at accuracies comparable to that of DeepWalk and related methods, although it falls short of SOTA Graph Neural Network (GNN) methods that rely on computationally expensive iterative training.

One of the central observations in network science is that real-world graphs are globally sparse, yet contains numerous \"pockets\" of high edge density. A fundamental task in graph mining is to discover these dense subgraphs. Most common formulations of the problem involve finding a single (or a few) \"optimally\" dense subsets. But in most real applications, one does not care for the optimality. Instead, we want to find a large collection of dense subsets that covers a significant fraction of the input graph.\n  We give a mathematical formulation of this problem, using a new definition of regularly triangle-rich (RTR) families. These families capture the notion of dense subgraphs that contain many triangles and have degrees comparable to the subgraph size. We design a provable algorithm, RTRExtractor, that can discover RTR families that approximately cover any RTR set. The algorithm is efficient and is inspired by recent results that use triangle counts for community testing and clustering.\n  We show that RTRExtractor has excellent behavior on a large variety of real-world datasets. It is able to process graphs with hundreds of millions of edges within minutes. Across many datasets, RTRExtractor achieves high coverage using high edge density datasets. For example, the output covers a quarter of the vertices with subgraphs of edge density more than (say) $0.5$, for datasets with 10M+ edges.

This paper considers the spatiotemporal dynamics of the Covid-19 pandemic via a developed methodology of non-Euclidean spatially aware functional registration. In particular, the daily SARS-CoV-2 incidence in each of 380 local authorities in the UK from March to June 2020 is analysed to understand the phase variation of the waves when considered as curves. This is achieved by adapting a traditional registration method (that of local variation analysis) to account for the clear spatial dependencies in the data. This adapted methodology is shown via simulation studies to perform substantially better for the estimation of the registration functions than the non-spatial alternative. Moreover, it is found that the driving time between locations represents the spatial dependency in the Covid-19 data better than geographical distance. However, since driving time is non-Euclidean, the traditional spatial frameworks break down; to solve this, a methodology inspired by multidimensional scaling is developed to approximate the driving times by a Euclidean distance which enables the established theory to be applied.

In this article, we establish theoretical guarantees for the recovery of the hierarchical tree and community structure of a Hierarchical Stochastic Block Model by a bottom-up algorithm. We also establish that this bottom-up algorithm attains the information-theoretic threshold for exact recovery at intermediate levels of the hierarchy. Notably, these recovery conditions are less restrictive compared to those existing for top-down algorithms. This shows that bottom-up algorithms extend the feasible region for achieving exact recovery at intermediate levels.

These participants may have different or conflicting goals and interests, which raise the need for fairness and popularity bias considerations. GNN-based recommendation methods also face the challenges of unfairness and popularity bias and their normalization and aggregation processes suffer from these challenges. In this paper, we propose a fair GNN-based recommender system, called HetroFair, to improve items' side fairness. HetroFair uses two separate components to generate fairness-aware embeddings: i) fairnessaware attention which incorporates dot product in the normalization process of GNNs, to decrease the effect of nodes' degrees, and ii) heterophily feature weighting to assign distinct weights to different features during the aggregation process. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of HetroFair, we conduct extensive experiments over six real-world datasets.

In this context, we aim to achieve three goals: (a) instantly detecting anomalies as they occur, (b) adapting to dynamically changing states, and (c) handling the scarcity of dynamic anomaly labels. In this paper, we propose SLADE (Self-supervised Learning for Anomaly Detection in Edge Streams) for rapid detection of dynamic anomalies in edge streams, without relying on labels. SLADE detects the shifts of nodes into abnormal states by observing deviations in their interaction patterns over time. To this end, it trains a deep neural network to perform two self-supervised tasks: (a) minimizing drift in node representations and (b) generating long-term interaction patterns from short-term ones. Failure in these tasks for a node signals its deviation from the norm. Notably, the neural network and tasks are carefully designed so that all required operations can be performed in constant time (w.r.t. the graph size) in response to each new edge in the input stream.

The primary research question is whether concealing the observation area is an adequate form of protection or whether human mobility patterns in urban areas are inherently revealing of location. The characteristics of the mobility data, such as the number of activity records or the number of unique users in a given spatial unit, reveal the silhouette of the urban landscape, which can be used to infer the identity of the city in question. It was demonstrated that even without disclosing the exact location, the patterns of human mobility can still reveal the urban area from which the data was collected. The presented locating method was tested on other cities using different open data sets and against coarser spatial discretization units. While publishing mobility data is essential for research, it was demonstrated that concealing the observation area is insufficient to prevent the identification of the urban area.

While existing traffic forecasting models primarily rely on raw traffic data and advanced deep learning techniques, incorporating contextual information remains underexplored due to the lack of effective integration frameworks and the complexity of urban contexts. This study proposes a novel context-aware knowledge graph (CKG) framework to enhance traffic speed forecasting by effectively modeling spatial and temporal contexts. Employing a relation-dependent integration strategy, the framework generates context-aware representations from the spatial and temporal units of CKG to capture spatio-temporal dependencies of urban contexts. A CKG-GNN model, combining the CKG, dual-view multi-head self-attention (MHSA), and graph neural network (GNN), is then designed to predict traffic speed using these context-aware representations. Our experiments demonstrate that CKG's configuration significantly influences embedding performance, with ComplEx and KG2E emerging as optimal for embedding spatial and temporal units, respectively. The CKG-GNN model surpasses benchmark models, achieving an average MAE of $3.46\\pm0.01$ and a MAPE of $14.76\\pm0.09\\%$ for traffic speed predictions from 10 to 120 minutes. The dual-view MHSA analysis reveals the crucial role of relation-dependent features from the context-based view and the model's ability to prioritize recent time slots in prediction from the sequence-based view. The CKG framework's model-agnostic nature suggests its potential applicability in various applications of intelligent transportation systems.

Past works on detecting accounts belonging to state-backed operations focus on a single campaign. While campaign-specific detection techniques are easier to build, there is no work done on developing systems that are campaign-agnostic and offer generalized detection of troll accounts unaffected by the biases of the specific campaign they belong to.

Social event detection is important in numerous areas, such as opinion analysis, social safety, and decision-making. Most current methods are supervised and require access to large amounts of data. These methods need prior knowledge of the events and carry a high risk of leaking sensitive information in the messages, making them less applicable in open-world settings. Therefore, conducting unsupervised detection while fully utilizing the rich information in the messages and protecting data privacy remains a significant challenge. To this end, we propose a novel social event detection framework, ADP-SEMEvent, an unsupervised social event detection method that prioritizes privacy. Specifically, ADP-SEMEvent is divided into two stages, i.e., the construction stage of the private message graph and the clustering stage of the private message graph. In the first stage, an adaptive differential privacy approach is used to construct a private message graph. In this process, our method can adaptively apply differential privacy based on the events occurring each day in an open environment to maximize the use of the privacy budget. In the second stage, to address the reduction in data utility caused by noise, a novel 2-dimensional structural entropy minimization algorithm based on optimal subgraphs is used to detect events in the message graph. The highlight of this process is unsupervised and does not compromise differential privacy.

Forcing net-zero emissions in every country increases system cost by 1.4%, demands varied CO2 prices, and triggers higher investment in direct air capture and renewable capacities.

Theories in moral psychology suggest that political parties would treat concerns for children using different moral frames, and that moral conflict might drive substantial polarization in discussions about children. However, such partisan frames may still differ very little if there is limited underlying disagreement about moral issues and everyday concerns in childhood when not explicitly referencing politics. We evaluate claims of universality and division in moral language using tweets from 2019-2023 linked to U.S. voter records, focusing on expressed morality. Our results show that mentions of children by Republicans and Democrats are usually similar, differing no more than mentions by women and men, and tend to contain no large differences in accompanying moral words. To the extent that mentions of children did differ across parties, these differences were constrained to topics polarized well before the pandemic -- and slightly heightened when co-mentioned with `kids' or `children'. These topics reflected a small fraction of conversations about children. Overall, polarization of online discussion around childhood appears to reflect escalated polarization on lines of existing partisan conflicts rather than concerns originating from new concerns about the welfare of children during and after the pandemic."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18376": {"title": "Exploring Bengali Religious Dialect Biases in Large Language Models with Evaluation Perspectives", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18376", "description": "arXiv:2407.18376v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: While Large Language Models (LLM) have created a massive technological impact in the past decade, allowing for human-enabled applications, they can produce output that contains stereotypes and biases, especially when using low-resource languages.

This study aims to fill this critical gap by advancing the understanding and protection against privacy risks emanating from network structure, moving beyond direct connections with neighbors to include the broader implications of indirect network structural patterns. To achieve this, we first investigate the problem of Graph Privacy Leakage via Structure (GPS), and introduce a novel measure, the Generalized Homophily Ratio, to quantify the various mechanisms contributing to privacy breach risks in GPS. Based on this insight, we develop a novel graph private attribute inference attack, which acts as a pivotal tool for evaluating the potential for privacy leakage through network structures under worst-case scenarios. To protect users' private data from such vulnerabilities, we propose a graph data publishing method incorporating a learnable graph sampling technique, effectively transforming the original graph into a privacy-preserving version.

Employing replicator dynamics, we find that unlike destructive agents, the mere presence of constructive agents does not significantly alter the defective equilibrium. However, when the benefits from constructive agents are outweighed by the damage inflicted by destructive agents, the addition of constructive agents does not affect the ability of destructive agents to sustain cooperation. In this scenario, cooperators can be maintained through a cyclic dominance between cooperators, defectors, and destructive agents, with constructive agents adding complexity but not fundamentally changing the equilibrium.

Among the existing models that may capture risk-taking behaviors are: 1) the social force models (through the interplay of the repulsion and the attraction force parameters); 2) and the discrete-choice models (through the rationality or the bounded rationality paradigm while weighing different alternatives). Given that the social force models may not readily capture the contact/collision dynamics through the Newtonian force framework, decision-making theories are hypothesized as a feasible approach to formulate a new model that can account for cognitive and behavioral dimensions such as uncertainty and risk. However, instead of relying on the bounded rationality theory, in this paper, a generalized Prospect Theory based microsimulation model is proposed. The model relies on the micro-economics Prospect Theory paradigm where pedestrians or bicyclists (i.e., micro-mobility users) evaluate their speed and directional alternatives while considering the possibility of colliding with other obstacles/users.

This has been complemented by sequence mining approaches, a key example being sequential motifs measuring the prevalence of recurrent subsequences. Previous work on higher-order networks has focused on how to identify the optimal order for a path dataset, where the order can be thought of as the number of steps of memory encoded in the model. In this paper, we build on these approaches to consider which orders are necessary to reproduce different path characteristics, from path lengths to counts of sequential motifs, viewing paths generated from different higher-order models as null models which capture features of the data up to a certain order, and randomised otherwise. Furthermore, we provide an important extension to motif counting, whereby cases with self-loops, starting nodes, and ending nodes of paths are taken into consideration.

Recently, Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation (UGDA) has been introduced to resolve this issue. UGDA aims to facilitate knowledge transfer from a labeled source graph to an unlabeled target graph. Current UGDA efforts primarily focus on model-centric methods, such as employing domain invariant learning strategies and designing model architectures.

In this paper, we analyze the role of user characteristics in hate speech resharing across different types of hate speech (e.g., political hate). For this, we proceed as follows: First, we cluster hate speech posts using large language models to identify different types of hate speech. Then we model the effects of user attributes on users' probability to reshare hate speech using an explainable machine learning model. To do so, we apply debiasing to control for selection bias in our observational social media data and further control for the latent vulnerability of users to hate speech. We find that, all else equal, users with fewer followers, fewer friends, fewer posts, and older accounts share more hate speech. This shows that users with little social influence tend to share more hate speech. Further, we find substantial heterogeneity across different types of hate speech. For example, racist and misogynistic hate is spread mostly by users with little social influence. In contrast, political anti-Trump and anti-right-wing hate is reshared by users with larger social influence.

In the second one, one or few lines become overloaded, which eventually renders one Lyapunov exponent positive. The first scenario is obviously less generic and we develop a numerical approach to force the splitting of the AC grid into disconnected areas. Remarkably, the critical lines identified in this way match those that triggered the separation of the synchronous grid of continental Europe in two instances in 2021. We further discuss how the modes of the system provide information on which areas are more susceptible to lose synchrony with each other."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15988": {"title": "Towards Fair Graph Anomaly Detection: Problem, Benchmark Datasets, and Evaluation", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15988", "description": "arXiv:2402.15988v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: The Fair Graph Anomaly Detection (FairGAD) problem aims to accurately detect anomalous nodes in an input graph while avoiding biased predictions against individuals from sensitive subgroups.

We divide these networks into three categories: lattice-like networks, trees, and linked trees. The degree distribution of these physical networks is bounded, with most nodes having degrees one or three. Characterizing the physical properties of links, we show that links have an elongated shape and tend to follow a nearly straight trajectory, while a small fraction of links follow a winding path. These typical node and link properties must be reflected by physical network models. We also measure how confined a link is in space by comparing its trajectory to a randomized null model, showing that links that are central in the abstract network tend to be physically confined by their neighbors.

The survey's final aim was to estimate differences in contact and protective behaviors across various population strata, both being key components of transmission dynamics. Our initial insights based on the survey indicate that years after the pandemic began, the perceived impact of COVID-19 on professional, economic, social, and psychological dimensions varied across socioeconomic strata, extending beyond the heterogeneity observed in the epidemiological outcomes of the pandemic. This reinforces the need for approaches that systematically consider socioeconomic determinants. In this context, using generalized models, we identified associations between socioeconomic factors and vaccination status for both COVID-19 and influenza, as well as the influence of socioeconomic conditions on mask-wearing and social distancing.

Previous work showed the effectiveness of Langevin-like equations in capturing the statistical properties of pedestrian dynamics in simple settings, such as almost straight trajectories. However, modeling more complex dynamics, e.g. when multiple routes and origin-destinations are involved, remains a significant challenge. In this work, we introduce a novel and generic framework to describe the dynamics of pedestrians in any geometric setting, significantly extending previous works. Our model is based on Langevin dynamics with two timescales. The fast timescale corresponds to the stochastic fluctuations present when a pedestrian is walking. The slow timescale is associated with the dynamics that a pedestrian plans to follow, thus a smoother path. Employing a data-driven approach inspired by statistical field theories, we learn the complex potentials directly from the data, namely a high-statistics database of real-life pedestrian trajectories. This approach makes the model generic as the potentials can be read from any trajectory data set and the underlying Langevin structure enables physics-based insights. We validate our model through a comprehensive statistical analysis, comparing simulated trajectories with actual pedestrian measurements across five complementary settings, including a real-life train platform scenario, underscoring its practical societal relevance.

However, the literature on decision-making includes models where social learners employ either symmetric or nonsymmetric conformity functions. We generalize a particular case studied in a previous work, and we show analytically that if the conformity function is symmetric, the details of the probability distribution of the propensity of the agents to behave as a social or an individual learner do not matter, only its expected value influences the determination of the steady state. We also show that in this case, the same steady state is reached for two extreme dynamical processes: one that considers propensities as idiosyncratic properties of the agents (each agent being an individual learner always with the same probability), and the opposite one, which allows them to change their propensity during the dynamics.

Specifically, in the model, the dynamics result from the agents trying to position themselves in the quest to avoid physical crowding experienced locally. We characterize in detail the dependence of the emergent behavior of the model on the population density of the system and the individual-level agent traits such as the extent of space an agent considers as her neighborhood, the limit of occupation density one tolerates within that neighborhood, and the information accessibility of the agents about neighborhood occupancy. We show that the efficiency with which the agents utilize the physical space shows transitions at two values of densities. The first of these transitions demarcates efficient and inefficient phases of the system, and the second one signifies the density at which the inefficiency is maximum. We show that the variation of inefficiency with respect to the information accessible to the agents shows opposing behavior above and below this second transition density.

However, there is a prevailing concern that sellers often post fake or spam reviews to deceive potential customers and manipulate their opinions about a product. Over the past decade, there has been considerable interest in using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models to identify such fraudulent reviews. Unfortunately, the decisions made by complex ML and DL models - which often function as \\emph{black-boxes} - can be surprising and difficult for general users to comprehend. In this paper, we propose an explainable framework for detecting fake reviews with high precision in identifying fraudulent content with explanations and investigate what information matters most for explaining particular decisions by conducting empirical user evaluation. Initially, we develop fake review detection models using DL and transformer models including XLNet and DistilBERT. We then introduce layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) technique for generating explanations that can map the contributions of words toward the predicted class. The experimental results on two benchmark fake review detection datasets demonstrate that our predictive models achieve state-of-the-art performance and outperform several existing methods.

In this problem, there are $n$ men and $n$ women, each having preference over the other side. It is assumed that women know their preferences over men, but men are not aware of their preferences over women, and they only learn them if they propose and successfully get matched to women. A matching is called stable if no man and woman prefer each other over their current matches. When all the preferences are known a priori, the celebrated Deferred-Acceptance algorithm proposed by Gale and Shapley provides a decentralized and uncoordinated algorithm to obtain a stable matching. However, when the preferences are unknown, developing such an algorithm faces major challenges due to a lack of coordination. We achieve this goal by making a connection between stable matchings and learning Nash equilibria (NE) in noncooperative games. First, we provide a complete information game formulation for the stable matching problem with known preferences such that its set of pure NE coincides with the set of stable matchings, while its mixed NE can be rounded in a decentralized manner to a stable matching. Relying on such a game-theoretic formulation, we show that for hierarchical markets, adopting the exponential weight (EXP) learning algorithm for the stable matching game achieves logarithmic regret with polynomial dependence on the number of players, thus answering a question posed in previous literature. Moreover, we show that the same EXP learning algorithm converges locally and exponentially fast to a stable matching in general matching markets. We complement this result by introducing another decentralized and uncoordinated learning algorithm that globally converges to a stable matching with arbitrarily high probability, leveraging the weak acyclicity property of the stable matching game."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21592": {"title": "Does the Source of a Warning Matter?

The present article explains the formation and maintenance of coalitions by focusing on the ways actors adopt policy beliefs from other actors in policy debates. A policy debate is a complex social system in which temporal network dependence guides how actors contribute ideological statements to the debate. Belief adoption matters in three complementary ways: bonding, which exploits cues within coalitions; bridging, which explores new beliefs outside one's perimeter in the debate; and repulsion, which reinforces polarization between coalitions and cements their belief systems.

Despite the promising results achieved, previous methods usually employ an entangled paradigm of redundant parameters (nodes, edges, GNNs), which incurs complex joint optimization during condensation. This paradigm has considerably impeded the scalability of graph condensation, making it challenging to condense extremely large-scale graphs and generate high-fidelity condensed graphs. Therefore, we propose to disentangle the condensation process into a two-stage GNN-free paradigm, independently condensing nodes and generating edges while eliminating the need to optimize GNNs at the same time. The node condensation module avoids the complexity of GNNs by focusing on node feature alignment with anchors of the original graph, while the edge translation module constructs the edges of the condensed nodes by transferring the original structure knowledge with neighborhood anchors. This simple yet effective approach achieves at least 10 times faster than state-of-the-art methods with comparable accuracy on medium-scale graphs.

To unravel the profound impact of such group support on a system's resilience against cascading failures, we devise a framework comprising a double-layer interdependent hypergraph system, wherein nodes are capable of receiving support via hyperedges. Our central hypothesis posits that the failure may transcend to another layer when all support groups of each dependent node fail, thereby initiating a potentially iterative cascade across layers. Through rigorous analytical methods, we derive the critical threshold for the initial node survival probability that marks the second-order phase transition point. A salient discovery is that as the prevalence of dependent nodes escalates, the system dynamics shift from a second-order to a first-order phase transition. Notably, irrespective of the collapse pattern, systems characterized by scale-free hyperdegree distributions within both hypergraph layers consistently demonstrate superior robustness compared to those adhering to Poisson hyperdegree distributions. In summary, our research underscores the paramount significance of group support mechanisms and intricate network topologies in determining the resilience of interconnected systems against the propagation of cascading failures. By exploring the interplay between these factors, we have gained insights into how systems can be designed or optimized to mitigate the risk of widespread disruptions, ensuring their continued functionality and stability in the face of adverse events."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01257": {"title": "Detection and Characterization of Coordinated Online Behavior: A Survey", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01257", "description": "arXiv:2408.01257v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Coordination is a fundamental aspect of life.

In a non-geometric setting Fountoulakis, Panagiotou and Sauerwald have shown that rumours always spread fast (SODA 2012). On the other hand, Janssen and Mehrabian have found that rumours spread slowly in a spatial preferential attachment model (SIDMA 2017). We study the question systematically for the model of geometric inhomogeneous random graphs (GIRGs), which has been found to be a good theoretical and empirical fit for social networks. Our result is two-fold: with classical Euclidean geometry both slow and fast rumour spreading may occur, depending on the exponent of the power law and the prevalence of weak ties in the networks, and we fully characterise the phase boundaries between those two regimes. Depending on the parameters, fast spreading may either mean polylogarithmic time or even doubly logarithmic time. Secondly, we show that rumour spreading is always fast in a non-metric geometry. The considered non-metric geometry allows to model social connections where resemblance of vertices in a single attribute, such as familial kinship, already strongly indicates the presence of an edge. Classical Euclidean Geometry fails to capture such ties.\n  For some regimes in the Euclidean setting, the efficient pathways for spreading rumours differ from previously identified paths.

Here, we develop a probabilistic framework to study the cooperative behavior in stochastic nonlinear public goods games. Through both analytical treatment and Monte Carlo simulations, we provide comprehensive understanding of social dilemmas with stochastic nonlinearity in both well-mixed and structured populations. We find that increasing the degree of nonlinearity makes synergy more advantageous when competing with discounting, thereby promoting cooperation. Interestingly, we show that network reciprocity loses effectiveness when the probability of synergy is small. Moreover, group size exhibits nonlinear effects on group cooperation regardless of the underlying structure.

In this work, we look for mesostructural conditions that arise when core nodes are significantly more influential than periphery nodes. In particular, we investigate the roles of the internal and external connectivity of cores in their relative influence. We observe that the internal and external connectivity of cores are broadly distributed, and the relative influence of the cores is also broadly distributed in real-world networks. Our key finding is that the internal connectivity of cores is positively correlated with their relative influence, whereas the relative influence increases up to a certain value of the external connectivity and decreases thereafter.

By leveraging widely deployed pan-tilt-cameras (PTCs), TTC-X overcomes the limitations of a fixed field of view in traditional surveillance systems by providing mobilized and 360-degree coverage. The innovation of TTC-X lies in the integration of advanced machine learning modules, including a detector-predictor-controller structure, with a novel Predictive Correlated Online Learning (PiCOL) methodology and the Spatial-Temporal Graph Predictor (STGP) for real-time traffic estimation and PTC control. The TTC-X is tested and evaluated under three experimental scenarios (e.g., maximum traffic flow capture, dynamic route planning, traffic state estimation) based on a simulation environment calibrated using real-world traffic data in Brooklyn, New York. The experimental results showed that TTC-X captured over 60\\% total number of vehicles at the network level, dynamically adjusted its route recommendation in reaction to unexpected full-lane closure events, and reconstructed link-level traffic states with best MAE less than 1.25 vehicle/hour. Demonstrating scalability, cost-efficiency, and adaptability, TTC-X emerges as a powerful solution for urban traffic management in both cyber-physical and real-world environments."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03924": {"title": "Network Analysis of U", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03924", "description": "arXiv:2402.03924v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: We present a nation-wide network analysis of non-fatal opioid-involved overdose journeys in the United States.

In response to these challenges, this paper proposes a novel Twitter Bot Detection framework called BotSAI. This framework enhances the consistency of multimodal user features, accurately characterizing various modalities to distinguish between real users and bots. Specifically, the architecture integrates information from users, textual content, and heterogeneous network topologies, leveraging customized encoders to obtain comprehensive user feature representations. The heterogeneous network encoder efficiently aggregates information from neighboring nodes through oversampling techniques and local relationship transformers. Subsequently, a multi-channel representation mechanism maps user representations into invariant and specific subspaces, enhancing the feature vectors. Finally, a self-attention mechanism is introduced to integrate and refine the enhanced user representations, enabling efficient information interaction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BotSAI outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on two major Twitter Bot Detection benchmarks, exhibiting superior performance.

To remedy this situation, we build on the axiomatic approach in the economics literature on income bipolarization, specifying key properties a measure of bipolarization should satisfy: in particular, it should increase as the distribution spreads away from a center toward the poles and/or as clustering below or above this center increases. We then show that measures of bipolarization used in public opinion research fail to satisfy one or more of these axioms.

We provide a worldwide quantification of how close cities are to the ideal of the 15-minute city. To this end, we measure the accessibility times to resources and services, and we reveal strong heterogeneity of accessibility within and across cities, with a significant role played by local population densities. We provide an online platform (\\href{whatif.sonycsl.it/15mincity}{whatif.sonycsl.it/15mincity}) to access and visualise accessibility scores for virtually all cities worldwide. The heterogeneity of accessibility within cities is one of the sources of inequality. We thus simulate how much a better redistribution of resources and services could heal inequity by keeping the same resources and services or by allowing for virtually infinite resources. We highlight pronounced discrepancies among cities in the minimum number of additional services needed to comply with the 15-minute city concept. We conclude that the proximity-based paradigm must be generalised to work on a wide range of local population densities. Finally, socio-economic and cultural factors should be included to shift from time-based to value-based cities."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03828": {"title": "More than 'Left and Right': Revealing Multilevel Online Political Selective Exposure", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03828", "description": "arXiv:2408.03828v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Selective exposure, individuals' inclination to seek out information that supports their beliefs while avoiding information that contradicts them, plays an important role in the emergence of polarization. In the political domain, selective exposure is usually measured on a left-right ideology scale, ignoring finer details. Here, we combine survey and Twitter data collected during the 2022 Brazilian Presidential Election and investigate selective exposure patterns between the survey respondents and political influencers. We analyze the followship network between survey respondents and political influencers and find a multilevel community structure that reveals a hierarchical organization more complex than a simple split between left and right. Moreover, depending on the level we consider, we find different associations between network indices of exposure patterns and 189 individual attributes of the survey respondents. For example, at finer levels, the number of influencer communities a survey respondent follows is associated with several factors, such as demographics, news consumption frequency, and incivility perception. In comparison, only their political ideology is a significant factor at coarser levels.

We show that the relationship between \"bridging\" amenities and socio-economic mixing breaks down when we examine the amenities themselves, rather than the urban aggregates. For example, restaurants with locations that suggest low expected mixing do not, much of the time, have low mixing: there is only a weak correlation between bridging and mixing at the level of the restaurant, despite a strong correlation at the level of the supermarket.

It is shown that the improved algorithm proposed in this paper performs well in user ad click prediction with an accuracy of 92%, which is an improvement of 13.6% compared to the highest of 78.4% among the other three base models.

So far, how to leverage LLMs to better detect local communities remains underexplored. Local community detection algorithms based on seed expansion often face a seed-dependent problem, community diffusion, and free rider effect. Using LLMs to solve existing local community work problems faces the following challenges: existing graph encoding methods fail to provide LLMs with sufficient community-related graph information; LLMs lack domain knowledge in mining communities. To address these issues, we improve graph encoding by supplementing community knowledge to enhance the ability of graph encoding to express graph information. Additionally, we design the NSG (Node Selection Guide) prompt to enhance LLMs' understanding of community characteristics, aiming to alleviate the seed-dependent problem, community diffusion, and free rider effect. Based on the graph encoding and NSG prompt, we present a GPT-guided local community detection, called ComGPT.

Sleeping Beauty is put asleep, and a coin is tossed. If the outcome of the coin toss is Tails, Sleeping Beauty is woken up on Monday, put asleep again and woken up again on Tuesday (with no recollection of having woken up on Monday). If the outcome is Heads, Sleeping Beauty is woken up on Monday only. Each time Sleeping Beauty is woken up, she is asked what her belief is that the outcome was Heads. What should Sleeping Beauty reply? In literature arguments have been given for both 1/3 and 1/2 as the correct answer. In this short note we argue using simple Bayesian probability theory why 1/3 is the right answer, and not 1/2. Briefly, when Sleeping Beauty awakens, her being awake is nontrivial extra information that leads her to update her beliefs about Heads to 1/3. We strengthen our claim by considering an additional observer, Prince Probability, who may or may not meet Sleeping Beauty. If he meets Sleeping Beauty while she is awake, he lowers his credence in Heads to 1/3.

Fringe social media platforms such as Parler, Gab, and Gettr often have minimal moderation, which facilitates the spread of hate speech and misinformation.

Entendre can process a labeled dataset from any social platform to produce a tailored bot detection model using a random forest classification approach, ensuring robust social bot detection. We exploit the idea that most social platforms share a generic template, where users can post content, approve content, and provide a bio (common data features).

These methods cannot fully address the complexities of real-world large-scale networks, which often involve higher-order node relations beyond only being pairwise. Meanwhile, real-world graph datasets are predominantly modelled as simple graphs, due to the scarcity of data that can be used to form higher-order edges. Therefore, reconfiguring the higher-order edges as an integration into graph augmentation strategies lights up a promising research path to address the aforementioned issues. In this paper, we present Topological Augmentation (TopoAug), a novel graph augmentation method that builds a combinatorial complex from the original graph by constructing virtual hyperedges directly from the raw data.

The largest geographic clusters correspond to the New and Old Worlds, which further divide into smaller bioregions. This hierarchical manifestation closely aligns with historical human migration patterns at a large scale, suggesting that narrative themes were carried through deep history. At smaller scales, the correspondence with bioregions indicates that these themes are locally adapted and diffused into variations across cultures over time.

They guide individuals in deriving meaning from their lives, shaping their behaviors, and forming social connections. Therefore, a model that encapsulates beliefs and their interrelationships is crucial for quantitatively studying the influence of beliefs on our actions. Despite its importance, research on the interplay between human beliefs has often been limited to a small set of beliefs pertaining to specific issues, with a heavy reliance on surveys or experiments. Here, we propose a method for extracting nuanced relations between thousands of beliefs by leveraging large-scale user participation data from an online debate platform and mapping these beliefs to an embedding space using a fine-tuned large language model (LLM). This belief embedding space effectively encapsulates the interconnectedness of diverse beliefs as well as polarization across various social issues. We discover that the positions within this belief space predict new beliefs of individuals. Furthermore, we find that the relative distance between one's existing beliefs and new beliefs can serve as a quantitative estimate of cognitive dissonance, allowing us to predict new beliefs.

A contact matrix $M$, having the \\emph{mean} number of contacts between individuals of different age groups as its elements, is estimated and used in combination with a multitype epidemic model to produce better data fitting and also giving more appropriate expressions for $R_0$ and other model outcomes. However, $M$ does not capture \\emph{variation} in contacts \\emph{within} each age group, which is often large in empirical settings. Here such variation within age groups is included in a simple way by dividing each age group into two halves: the socially active and the socially less active. The extended contact matrix, and its associated epidemic model, empirically show that acknowledging variation in social activity within age groups has a substantial impact on modelling outcomes such as $R_0$ and the final fraction $\\tau$ getting infected. In fact, the variation in social activity within age groups is often more important for data fitting than the division into different age groups itself. However, a difficulty with heterogeneity in social activity is that social contact studies typically lack information on if mixing with respect to social activity is assortative or not, i.e.\\ do socially active tend to mix more with other socially active or more with socially less active? The analyses show that accounting for heterogeneity in social activity improves the analyses irrespective of if such mixing is assortative or not, but the different assumptions gives rather different output. Future social contact studies should hence also try to infer the degree of assortativity of contacts with respect to social activity."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03569": {"title": "Opinion Dynamics Incorporating Higher-Order Interactions", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03569", "description": "arXiv:2102.03569v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: The issue of opinion sharing and formation has received considerable attention in the academic literature, and a few models have been proposed to study this problem.

However, the prevailing concept is misaligned with what is studied. While misinformation focuses on instances of information about factual matters, the broad spectrum of effects often manifests at a societal level and is shaped by a wide range of interdependent factors such as identity, values, opinions, epistemologies, and disagreements. Unsurprisingly, misinformation effects can occur without the prevalence of misinformation, and misinformation does not necessarily increase the effects studied. Here, we propose using disagreement - conflicting attitudes and beliefs between individuals and communities - as a way to study misinformation effects because it addresses the identified conceptual limitations of misinformation. Furthermore, unlike misinformation, disagreement does not require researchers to determine whether a given information is false or misleading. Thus, it can be studied and, more importantly, measured without the need to make a normative judgment about a given information, even when the specific topic is entirely removed, as we show in a longitudinal disagreement measurement. We demonstrate that disagreement, as a holistic concept, provides better explanations for the occurrence of misinformation effects, enhances precision in developing appropriate interventions, and offers a promising approach for evaluating them through quantification.

Not only in humans, but also in the cognitively-limited organisms, this interplay between the resource and the cooperation is ubiquitously witnessed. The strategically interacting players engaged in such game-environment feedback scenarios naturally pick strategies based on their perception of the environmental state. Such perception invariably happens through some sensory information channels that the players are endowed with. The unfortunate reality is that any sensory channel must be noisy due to various factors; consequently, the perception of the environmental state becomes faulty rendering the players incapable of adopting the strategy that they otherwise would. Intriguingly, situation is not as bad as it sounds. Here we introduce the hitherto neglected information channel between players and the environment into the paradigm of stochastic evolutionary games with a view to bringing forward the counterintuitive possibility of emergence and sustenance of cooperation on account of the noise in the channel. Our primary study is in the simplest non-trivial setting of two-state stochastically fluctuating resource harnessed by a large unstructured population of cooperators and defectors adopting either memory-1 strategies or reactive strategies while engaged in repeated two-player interactions. The effect of noisy information channel in enhancing the cooperation in reactive-strategied population is unprecedented.

We propose that these advances in our understanding of complex systems and computer science should be brought to bear on our investigations into human history. To that end, we present a new framework for modeling how human societies co-evolve with their biotic environments, recognizing that both a society and its environment are computers. This leads us to model the dynamics of each of those two systems using the same, new kind of computational machine, which we define here.

Transformers, as an emerging class of foundation encoders for graph-structured data, have shown promising performance on small graphs due to its global attention capable of capturing all-pair influence beyond neighboring nodes. Even so, existing approaches tend to inherit the spirit of Transformers in language and vision tasks, and embrace complicated models by stacking deep multi-head attentions. In this paper, we critically demonstrate that even using a one-layer attention can bring up surprisingly competitive performance across node property prediction benchmarks where node numbers range from thousand-level to billion-level. This encourages us to rethink the design philosophy for Transformers on large graphs, where the global attention is a computation overhead hindering the scalability. We frame the proposed scheme as Simplified Graph Transformers (SGFormer), which is empowered by a simple attention model that can efficiently propagate information among arbitrary nodes in one layer. SGFormer requires none of positional encodings, feature/graph pre-processing or augmented loss. Empirically, SGFormer successfully scales to the web-scale graph ogbn-papers100M and yields up to 141x inference acceleration over SOTA Transformers on medium-sized graphs.

The challenge is that distribution shifts on graphs involve intricate interconnections between nodes, and the environment labels are often absent in data. In this paper, we adopt a bottom-up data-generative perspective and reveal a key observation through causal analysis: the crux of GNNs' failure in OOD generalization lies in the latent confounding bias from the environment. The latter misguides the model to leverage environment-sensitive correlations between ego-graph features and target nodes' labels, resulting in undesirable generalization on new unseen nodes. Built upon this analysis, we introduce a conceptually simple yet principled approach for training robust GNNs under node-level distribution shifts, without prior knowledge of environment labels. Our method resorts to a new learning objective derived from causal inference that coordinates an environment estimator and a mixture-of-expert GNN predictor. The new approach can counteract the confounding bias in training data and facilitate learning generalizable predictive relations. Extensive experiment demonstrates that our model can effectively enhance generalization with various types of distribution shifts and yield up to 27.4\\% accuracy improvement over state-of-the-arts on graph OOD generalization benchmarks.

Most existing studies primarily utilize financial data for these predictions. However, research suggests that a firm's research and development activities and its network position within technological ecosystems may also serve as valuable predictors. To unpack the relative importance of diverse features, this paper analyzes financial and patent data from 5,071 firms, extracting three categories of features: financial features, technological features of granted patents, and network-based features derived from firms' connections to their primary technologies. By utilizing ensemble learning algorithms, we demonstrate that incorporating financial features with either technological, network-based features, or both, leads to more accurate high-growth firm predictions compared to using financial features alone. To delve deeper into the matter, we evaluate the predictive power of each individual feature within their respective categories using explainable artificial intelligence methods. Among non-financial features, the maximum economic value of a firm's granted patents and the number of patents related to a firms' primary technologies stand out for their importance. Furthermore, firm size is positively associated with high-growth probability up to a certain threshold size, after which the association plateaus. Conversely, the maximum economic value of a firm's granted patents is positively linked to high-growth probability only after a threshold value is exceeded. These findings elucidate the complex predictive role of various features in forecasting high-growth firms and could inform technological resource allocation as well as investment decisions."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09175": {"title": "Generative Agent-Based Models for Complex Systems Research: a review", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09175", "description": "arXiv:2408.09175v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly transformed the fields of natural and social sciences.

When individuals are incentivized to dig in and refuse to compromise, leaders may be essential to guiding the group to consensus. Specifically, the relative geodesic position of leaders (which we use as a proxy for ease of communication between leaders) could be important for reaching consensus. Additionally, groups searching for consensus can be confounded by noisy signals in which individuals are given false information about the actions of their fellow group members. We tested the effects of the geodesic distance between leaders (geodesic distance ranging from 1-4) and of noise (noise levels at 0%, 5%, and 10%) by recruiting participants (N=3,456) for a set of experiments (n=216 groups). We find that noise makes groups less likely to reach consensus, and the groups that do reach consensus take longer to find it. We find that leadership changes the behavior of both leaders and followers in important ways (for instance, being labeled a leader makes people more likely to 'go with the flow'). However, we find no evidence that the distance between leaders is a significant factor in the probability of reaching consensus.

Addressing this gap, our work introduces two temporal interaction mechanisms to model the stochastic or periodic participation of individuals in public goods games, acknowledging real-life variances due to exogenous temporal factors and geographical time differences. We consider that the interaction state significantly influences both game payoff calculations and the strategy updating process, offering new insights into the emergence and sustainability of cooperation. Our results indicate that maximum game participation frequency is suboptimal under a stochastic interaction mechanism. Instead, an intermediate activation probability maximizes cooperation, suggesting a vital balance between interaction frequency and inactivity security. Furthermore, local synchronization of interactions within specific areas is shown to be beneficial, as time differences hinder the spread of cross-structures but promote the formation of dense cooperative clusters with smoother boundaries.

Moreover, disinformation often spreads in direct competition with a corresponding true information. To model these phenomena, we develop a model for two competing beliefs spreading on a social network, where individuals have an internal opinion that models their cognitive biases and modulates their likelihood of adopting one of the competing beliefs. By numerical simulations of an agent-based model and a mean-field description of the dynamics, we study how the long-term dynamics of the spreading process depends on the initial conditions for the number of spreaders and the initial opinion of the population.

These tasks are particularly challenging in dynamic networks where communication across the network links may be unreliable, e.g., due to mobility or failures. Indeed, over the last years, researchers have derived several impossibility results and high time complexity lower bounds (i.e., linear in the number of nodes $n$) for these tasks, even for oblivious message adversaries where communication networks are rooted trees. However, such deterministic adversarial models may be overly conservative, as many processes in real-world settings are stochastic in nature rather than worst case.\n  This paper initiates the study of broadcast and consensus on stochastic dynamic networks, introducing a randomized oblivious message adversary. Our model is reminiscent of the SI model in epidemics, however, revolving around trees (which renders the analysis harder due to the apparent lack of independence). In particular, we show that if information dissemination occurs along random rooted trees, broadcast and consensus complete fast with high probability, namely in logarithmic time. Our analysis proves the independence of a key variable, which enables a formal understanding of the dissemination process.\n  More formally, for a network with $n$ nodes, we first consider the completely random case where in each round the communication network is chosen uniformly at random among rooted trees. We then introduce the notion of randomized oblivious message adversary, where in each round, an adversary can choose $k$ edges to appear in the communication network, and then a rooted tree is chosen uniformly at random among the set of all rooted trees that include these edges. We show that broadcast completes in $O(k+\\log n)$ rounds, and that this it is also the case for consensus as long as $k \\le 0.1n$."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05680": {"title": "Breaking Language Barriers with MMTweets: Advancing Cross-Lingual Debunked Narrative Retrieval for Fact-Checking", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05680", "description": "arXiv:2308.05680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Finding previously debunked narratives involves identifying claims that have already undergone fact-checking.

However, the statistical foundation for using IPF has not been well understood: under what settings does IPF provide principled estimation of a dynamic network from its marginals, and how well does it estimate the network? In this work, we establish such a setting, by identifying a generative network model whose maximum likelihood estimates are recovered by IPF. Our model both reveals implicit assumptions on the use of IPF in such settings and enables new analyses, such as structure-dependent error bounds on IPF's parameter estimates. When IPF fails to converge on sparse network data, we introduce a principled algorithm that guarantees IPF converges under minimal changes to the network structure.

The well-studied IC model fails to capture the feature of node recovery, and the SIR model is a variant of the IC model with the node recovery feature. In the SIR model, by computing the probability that a node successfully infects another before its recovery and viewing this probability as the corresponding IC parameter, the SIR model becomes an \"out-going-edge-correlated\" version of the IC model: the events of the infections along different out-going edges of a node become dependent in the SIR model, whereas these events are independent in the IC model. In this paper, we thoroughly compare the two models and examine the effect of this extra dependency in the SIR model. By a carefully designed coupling argument, we show that the seeds in the IC model have a stronger influence spread than their counterparts in the SIR model, and sometimes it can be significantly stronger. Specifically, we prove that, given the same network, the same seed sets, and the parameters of the two models being set based on the above-mentioned equivalence, the expected number of infected nodes at the end of the cascade for the IC model is weakly larger than that for the SIR model, and there are instances where this dominance is significant.

Intriguingly, from the observation of heterophilous data, we notice that certain high-order information exhibits higher homophily, which motivates us to involve high-order information in node representation learning. However, common practices in GNNs to acquire high-order information mainly through increasing model depth and altering message-passing mechanisms, which, albeit effective to a certain extent, suffer from three shortcomings: 1) over-smoothing due to excessive model depth and propagation times; 2) high-order information is not fully utilized; 3) low computational efficiency. In this regard, we design a similarity-based path sampling strategy to capture smooth paths containing high-order homophily. Then we propose a lightweight model based on multi-layer perceptrons (MLP), named PathMLP, which can encode messages carried by paths via simple transformation and concatenation operations, and effectively learn node representations in heterophilous graphs through adaptive path aggregation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines on 16 out of 20 datasets, underlining its effectiveness and superiority in alleviating the heterophily problem.

Results: We identified five high-level topic categories in the toxic online discourse on Twitter, including disease (46.6%), health policy and healthcare (19.3%), homophobia (23.9%), politics (6.0%), and racism (4.1%). Through the toxicity diffusion networks of mentions, retweets, and the top users, we found that retweets of toxic content were widespread, while influential users rarely engaged with or countered this toxicity through retweets.

Community Notes is a crowdsourced fact-checking approach that allows users to write textual notes to inform others about potentially misleading posts on X/Twitter. Yet, empirical evidence regarding its effectiveness in reducing engagement with misinformation on social media is missing. In this paper, we perform a large-scale empirical study to analyze whether the introduction of the Community Notes feature and its roll-out to users in the U.S. and around the world have reduced engagement with misinformation on X/Twitter in terms of retweet volume and likes. We employ Difference-in-Differences (DiD) models and Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) to analyze a comprehensive dataset consisting of all fact-checking notes and corresponding source tweets since the launch of Community Notes in early 2021. Although we observe a significant increase in the volume of fact-checks carried out via Community Notes, particularly for tweets from verified users with many followers, we find no evidence that the introduction of Community Notes significantly reduced engagement with misleading tweets on X/Twitter.

This paper introduces a measurement framework to quantify how far researchers move from their existing research when producing new works. We apply this framework to millions of scientific publications and patents and uncover a pervasive \"pivot penalty\", where the impact of new research steeply declines the further a researcher moves from their prior work. The pivot penalty applies nearly universally across scientific publishing and patenting and has been growing in magnitude over the past five decades. While creativity frameworks suggest a benefit to exploratory search by researchers and often emphasize outsider advantages in driving breakthroughs, we find little evidence for such an advantage. The pivot penalty is consistent with increasingly narrow specializations of researchers, and when researchers undertake large pivots, a signature of their work is weak engagement with established mixtures of prior knowledge. Unexpected shocks to the research landscape, which may push researchers away from existing areas or pull them into new ones, further demonstrate substantial pivot penalties. COVID-19 provides a high-scale case study, where many researchers engaged the pandemic, yet the pivot penalty remains severe.

In this paper, we study the effects of group opinions on opinion dynamics. We formulate a hypergraph model in which both individual agents and groups of 3 agents have opinions, and we examine how opinions evolve through both dyadic interactions and group memberships. In some parameter regimes, we find that the presence of group opinions can lead to oscillatory and excitable opinion dynamics. In the oscillatory regime, the mean opinion of the agents in a network has self-sustained oscillations. In the excitable regime, finite-size effects create large but short-lived opinion swings (as in social fads). We develop a mean-field approximation of our model and obtain good agreement with direct numerical simulations. We also show, both numerically and via our mean-field description, that oscillatory dynamics occur only when the number of dyadic and polyadic interactions per agent are not completely correlated.

The majority of existing methods are performed in an unsupervised manner, as labeled anomalies in a large scale are often too expensive to acquire.

In real-world scenarios, it is often feasible to obtain limited labeled anomalies, which have great potential to advance graph anomaly detection. However, the work exploring limited labeled anomalies and a large amount of unlabeled nodes in graphs to detect anomalies is relatively limited. Therefore, in this paper, we study an important problem of few-shot graph anomaly detection. Nonetheless, it is challenging to fully leverage the information of few-shot anomalous nodes due to the irregularity of anomalies and the overfitting issue in the few-shot learning. To tackle the above challenges, we propose a novel meta-learning based framework, MetaGAD, that learns to adapt the knowledge from self-supervised learning to few-shot supervised learning for graph anomaly detection.

Previous studies have revealed that it is feasible to estimate the commuting origin-destination (OD) demand within a city using multiple auxiliary data. However, most existing methods are not suitable to deal with a similar task at a large scale, namely within a prefecture or the whole nation, owing to the increased number of geographical units that need to be maintained. In addition, region representation learning is a universal approach for gaining urban knowledge for diverse metropolitan downstream tasks. Although many researchers have developed comprehensive frameworks to describe urban units from multi-source data, they have not clarified the relationship between the selected geographical elements. Furthermore, metropolitan areas naturally preserve ranked structures, like cities and their inclusive districts, which makes elucidating relations between cross-level urban units necessary. Therefore, we develop a heterogeneous graph-based model to generate meaningful region embeddings at multiple spatial resolutions for predicting different types of inter-level OD flows. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive experiments were conducted using real-world aggregated mobile phone datasets collected from Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan.

We derive general analytical methods for evolutionary dynamics under high home fidelity when populations self-organize into networks of asymptotically isolated communities. In this limit, community organization dominates over the network structure and emerging behavior is independent of network topology. We obtain the rules of multiplayer cooperation in networks of communities for different types of social dilemmas. The success of cooperation is a result of the benefits shared amongst communal cooperators outperforming the benefits reaped by defectors in mixed communities. Under weak selection, cooperation can evolve and be stable for any size (Q) and number (M) of communities if the reward-to-cost ratio (V/K) of public goods is higher than a critical value. Community organization is a solid mechanism for sustaining the evolution of cooperation under public goods dilemmas, particularly when populations are organized into a higher number of smaller communities. Contrary to public goods dilemmas relating to production, the multiplayer Hawk-Dove (HD) dilemma is a commons dilemma focusing on the fair consumption of preexisting resources.

Moreover, we observe that models trained on existing media bias benchmarks fail to generalize effectively on recent social media posts, particularly in certain bias identification tasks.

We focus on three dimensions--power outage intensity, frequency, and duration--and develop multiple metrics to quantify each dimension of power outage vulnerability. The results show that in the past ten years, the vulnerability of U.S. power system has consistently been increasing. Counties experienced an average of 999.4 outages over the decade, affecting an average of more than 540,000 customers per county, with disruptions occurring approximately every week.

Using GPS mobility data, we construct a network of blocks from the sequence of individual stays in a major European city. A community detection algorithm allows us to partition this network into non-overlapping areas of dense mobility clusters, in which the effect of transportation hubs can be tuned with a parameter. We apply the Symmetric Area Difference index to quantify the overlap between these mobility clusters and the polygons of urban area separated by barriers. Reducing the effect of transportation hubs results in smaller scale mobility clusters that fit better to lower rank administrative or road barriers compared to their higher rank pairs. We find that characteristic urban barriers can replace each other in dividing mobility clusters of different scales. Next, we define the Barrier Crossing Ratio, the fraction of barrier crossings that bridge mobility clusters.

Yet, migrant populations were frequently observed to have lower access to health. The reasons for this are not entirely clear and may include language barriers, a lack of knowledge of the healthcare system, and selective migration (a \"healthy migrant\" effect). We use extensive medical claims data from Austria (13 million hospital stays of approximately 4 million individuals) to compare the healthcare utilization patterns between Austrians and non-Austrians. We looked at the differences in primary diagnoses and hospital sections of initial hospital admission across different nationalities. We hypothesize that cohorts experiencing the healthy migrant effect show lower readmission rates after hospitalization compared to migrant populations that are in poorer health but show lower hospitalization rates due to barriers in access. We indeed find that all nationalities showed lower hospitalization rates than Austrians, except for Germans, who exhibit a similar healthcare usage to Austrians. Although around 20\\% of the population has a migration background, non-Austrian citizens account for only 9.4% of the hospital patients and 9.79% of hospital nights. However, results for readmission rates are much more divergent. Nationalities like Hungary, Romania, and Turkey (females) show decreased readmission rates in line with the healthy migrant effect. Patients from Russia, Serbia, and Turkey (males) show increased readmissions, suggesting that their lower hospitalization rates are more likely due to access barriers.

This limitation presents a challenge for modeling various real-world phenomena, such as natural languages. To overcome this limitation, a probabilistic context-sensitive grammar (PCSG) is introduced, where the distribution of a subtree depends on its context. Numerical analysis of a PCSG reveals that the distribution of a symbol does not constitute a qualitative difference from that in the context-free case, but mutual information does. Furthermore, a novel metric introduced to directly quantify the breaking of this limitation detects a distinct difference between PCFGs and PCSGs. This metric, applicable to an arbitrary distribution of a tree, allows for further investigation and characterization of various tree structures that PCFGs cannot express."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10335": {"title": "Correlation Clustering with Vertex Splitting", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10335", "description": "arXiv:2402.10335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: We explore Cluster Editing and its generalization Correlation Clustering with a new operation called permissive vertex splitting which addresses finding overlapping clusters in the face of uncertain information.

This paper introduces an automatic and scalable stop-and-go wave identification method capable of capturing wave generation, propagation, dissipation, as well as bifurcation and merging, which have previously been observed only very rarely. Using a concise and simple critical-speed based definition of a stop-and-go wave, the proposed method identifies all wave boundaries that encompass spatio-temporal points where vehicle speed is below a chosen critical speed.

In particular, based on a large collection of classic literary works, it has been evidenced that the distances between consecutive punctuation marks, measured in terms of the number of words, obey the discrete Weibull distribution - a discrete variant of a distribution often used in survival analysis. The present work extends the analysis of punctuation usage patterns to more experimental pieces of world literature. It turns out that the compliance of the the distances between punctuation marks with the discrete Weibull distribution typically applies here as well. However, some of the works by James Joyce are distinct in this regard - in the sense that the tails of the relevant distributions are significantly thicker and, consequently, the corresponding hazard functions are decreasing functions not observed in typical literary texts in prose. \"Finnegans Wake\" - the same one to which science owes the word \"quarks\" for the most fundamental constituents of matter - is particularly striking in this context. At the same time, in all the studied texts, the sentence lengths - representing the distances between sentence-ending punctuation marks - reveal more freedom and are not constrained by the discrete Weibull distribution. This freedom in some cases translates into long-range nonlinear correlations, which manifest themselves in multifractality. Again, a text particularly spectacular in terms of multifractality is \"Finnegans Wake\"."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00823": {"title": "Enhancing Anti-Money Laundering Efforts with Network-Based Algorithms", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00823", "description": "arXiv:2409.00823v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The global banking system has faced increasing challenges in combating money laundering, necessitating advanced methods for detecting suspicious transactions.

Because conventional augmentation techniques like feature embedding masking cannot directly process textual attributes on TAGs. A naive strategy for applying GCL to TAGs is to encode the textual attributes into feature embeddings via a language model and then feed the embeddings into the following GCL module for processing.

Leveraging real-time data can significantly deal with data uncertainty and enhance disaster response efforts.

Strikingly, despite the abundance of networks with influencers, little is known about their response to stochastic forcing. Here, for oscillatory dynamics on influencer networks, we show that subjecting influencers to an optimal intensity of noise can result in enhanced network synchronization. This new network dynamical effect, which we call coherence resonance in influencer networks, emerges from a synergy between network structure and stochasticity and is highly nonlinear, vanishing when the noise is too weak or too strong.

Recent pre-computation-based HGNNs use one-time message passing to transform a heterogeneous graph into regular-shaped tensors, enabling efficient mini-batch training.

We find that LLMs are able to reach consensus in groups and that the opinion dynamics of LLMs can be understood with a function parametrized by a majority force coefficient that determines whether consensus is possible. This majority force is stronger for models with higher language understanding capabilities and decreases for larger groups, leading to a critical group size beyond which, for a given LLM, consensus is unfeasible.

To capture all transitions from phase disordered states over phase locking to fully synchronized systems, new metrics were proposed and demonstrated on homogeneous models. In this paper we aim to address a gap in the literature, namely, to examine how gradual improvement of power grid models affect the goodness of certain metrics. To study how the details of models are perceived by the different metrics, 12 variations of a power grid model were created, introducing varying level of heterogeneity through the coupling strength, the nodal powers and the moment of inertia. The grid models were compared using a second-order Kuramoto equation and adaptive Runge-Kutta solver, measuring the values of the phase, the frequency and the universal order parameters. Finally, frequency results of the models were compared to grid measurements. We found that the universal order parameter was able to capture more details of the grid models, especially in cases of decreasing moment of inertia.

The capital is assumed to be in the form of manufacturing equipment and materials. Two important parameters of the model are: the saving fraction $s$ of the output of a production function and the technology efficiency parameter $A$, appearing in the production function. The saved fraction of the output is fully invested in the generation of new capital and the rest is consumed. The capital stock also depreciates as a function of time due to the wearing out of old capital and the increase in the size of the labour population. We propose a stochastic Solow growth model assuming the saving fraction to be a sigmoidal function of the per capita capital $k_p$. We derive analytically the steady state probability distribution $P(k_p)$ and demonstrate the existence of a poverty trap, of central concern in development economics. In a parameter regime, $P(k_p)$ is bimodal with the twin peaks corresponding to states of poverty and well-being respectively.

Methods have been proposed to assess whether a real-world network is in a (quasi-)stationary state by checking the consistency of its structural evolution with appropriate maximum-entropy ensembles of graphs. While previous analyses of this kind have focused on dyadic and triadic motifs, hence disregarding higher-order structures, here we consider closed walks of any length. Specifically, we study the ensemble properties of the spectral radius of random graph models calibrated on real-world evolving networks. Our approach is shown to work remarkably well for directed networks, both binary and weighted. As illustrative examples, we consider the Electronic Market for Interbank Deposit (e-MID), the Dutch Interbank Network (DIN) and the International Trade Network (ITN) in their evolution across the 2008 crisis. By monitoring the deviation of the spectral radius from its ensemble expectation, we find that the ITN remains in a (quasi-)equilibrium state throughout the period considered, while both the DIN and e-MID exhibit a clear out-of-equilibrium behaviour. The spectral deviation therefore captures ongoing topological changes, extending over all length scales, to provide a compact proxy of the resilience of economic and financial networks."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03593": {"title": "Ensuring resilience to extreme weather events increases the ambition of mitigation scenarios on solar power and storage uptake: a study on the Italian power system", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03593", "description": "arXiv:2409.03593v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This study explores compounding impacts of climate change on power system's load and generation, emphasising the need to integrate adaptation and mitigation strategies into investment planning.

Our preliminary study highlights this issue, demonstrating that spatial random perturbations impact all frequency bands almost uniformly. Given that task-relevant information typically resides in specific spectral regions that vary across graphs, this one-size-fits-all approach can pose challenges.

In this paper, we study discussions of gun policy on Reddit, with the overarching goal of developing insights into the potential of the internet to support understanding across difference. We use two methods: a clustering analysis of Reddit posts to contribute insights about what people discuss, and an interview study of twenty Reddit users to help us understand why certain kinds of conversation take place and others don't. We find that the discussion of gun politics falls into three groups: conservative pro-gun, liberal pro-gun, and liberal anti-gun. Each type of group has its own characteristic topics.

Modeling and analyzing such interactions is crucial to understand social phenomena that happen when people face different opinions while expressing and discussing their values. In this work, we study a Reddit community in which people participate to judge or be judged with respect to some behavior, as it represents a valuable source to study how users express judgments online. We model threads of this community as complex networks of user interactions growing in time, and we analyze the evolution of their structural properties. We show that the evolution of Reddit networks differ from other real social networks, despite falling in the same category. This happens because their global clustering coefficient is extremely small and the average shortest path length increases over time. Such properties reveal how users discuss in threads, i.e. with mostly one other user and often by a single message. We strengthen such result by analyzing the role that disagreement and reciprocity play in such conversations. We also show that Reddit thread's evolution over time is governed by two subgraphs growing at different speeds. We discover that, in the studied community, the difference of such speed is higher than in other communities because of the user guidelines enforcing specific user interactions.

To delve deeper into these aspects, and particularly to uncover the roles of individual user taste and collective wisdom, we propose a unique and practical approach that emphasizes historical ratings at both the user and product levels, encapsulated using a continuously updated dynamic tree representation. This representation effectively captures the temporal dynamics of users and products, leverages user information across product categories, and provides a natural solution to the cold-start problem. Furthermore, we have developed an efficient data processing strategy that makes this approach highly scalable and easily deployable.

This intuition has been formalized with two types of models. In public assessment models, all community members are assumed to agree on each others' reputations; in private assessment models, people may have disagreements. Both types of models aim to understand the interplay of social norms and cooperation. Yet their results can be vastly different. Public assessment models argue that cooperation can evolve easily, and that the most effective norms tend to be stern. Private assessment models often find cooperation to be unstable, and successful norms show some leniency. Here, we propose a model that can organize these differing results within a single framework. We show that the stability of cooperation depends on a single quantity: the extent to which individual opinions turn out to be correlated. This correlation is determined by a group's norms and the structure of social interactions.

The paper includes both the ``survival\" as well as ``recovery\" components of resilience. It also strikes a middle ground between two disparate approaches to resilience measurement: structural measurement of formal graphs and detailed behavioral simulation. This paper also generalizes a previous resilience measure based on HFGT and benefits from recent theoretical and computational developments in HFGT. To demonstrate the methodological developments, the resilience analysis is conducted on a hypothetical energy-water nexus system of moderate size as a type of system-of-systems."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05292": {"title": "Mpox Narrative on Instagram: A Labeled Multilingual Dataset of Instagram Posts on Mpox for Sentiment, Hate Speech, and Anxiety Analysis", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05292", "description": "arXiv:2409.05292v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: The world is currently experiencing an outbreak of mpox, which has been declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by WHO. No prior work related to social media mining has focused on the development of a dataset of Instagram posts about the mpox outbreak. The work presented in this paper aims to address this research gap and makes two scientific contributions to this field. First, it presents a multilingual dataset of 60,127 Instagram posts about mpox, published between July 23, 2022, and September 5, 2024. The dataset, available at https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/7fvc-y093, contains Instagram posts about mpox in 52 languages. For each of these posts, the Post ID, Post Description, Date of publication, language, and translated version of the post (translation to English was performed using the Google Translate API) are presented as separate attributes in the dataset. After developing this dataset, sentiment analysis, hate speech detection, and anxiety or stress detection were performed. This process included classifying each post into (i) one of the sentiment classes, i.e., fear, surprise, joy, sadness, anger, disgust, or neutral, (ii) hate or not hate, and (iii) anxiety/stress detected or no anxiety/stress detected. These results are presented as separate attributes in the dataset. Second, this paper presents the results of performing sentiment analysis, hate speech analysis, and anxiety or stress analysis. The variation of the sentiment classes - fear, surprise, joy, sadness, anger, disgust, and neutral were observed to be 27.95%, 2.57%, 8.69%, 5.94%, 2.69%, 1.53%, and 50.64%, respectively. In terms of hate speech detection, 95.75% of the posts did not contain hate and the remaining 4.25% of the posts contained hate.

In this paper, we endeavor to furnish a comprehensive review of GNNs in epidemic tasks and highlight potential future directions. To accomplish this objective, we introduce hierarchical taxonomies for both epidemic tasks and methodologies, offering a trajectory of development within this domain. For epidemic tasks, we establish a taxonomy akin to those typically employed within the epidemic domain. For methodology, we categorize existing work into Neural Models and Hybrid Models. Following this, we perform an exhaustive and systematic examination of the methodologies, encompassing both the tasks and their technical details.

Text data, with its syntax, semantics, and even hidden information content, possesses an exceptional place among the data types in concern. The processing of the text data requires embedding, a method of translating the content of the text to numeric vectors. A correct embedding algorithm is the starting point for obtaining the full information content of the text data. In this work, a new text embedding approach, namely the Guided Transition Probability Matrix (GTPM) model is proposed. The model uses the graph structure of sentences to capture different types of information from text data, such as syntactic, semantic, and hidden content. Using random walks on a weighted word graph, GTPM calculates transition probabilities to derive text embedding vectors. The proposed method is tested with real-world data sets and eight well-known and successful embedding algorithms. GTPM shows significantly better classification performance for binary and multi-class datasets than well-known algorithms.

The purpose of present work was twofold: to test the hypotheses already examined on evolving transmission networks and to gain a deeper understanding on the nature of these inherent weaknesses. For this, historical models of a medium-voltage distribution network supply area were reconstructed and analysed. Topological efficiency of the networks was calculated against node and edge removals of different proportions. We found that the tolerance of the evolving grid remained practically unchanged during the examined period, implying that the increase in size is dominantly caused by the connection of geographically and spatially constrained supply areas and not by an evolutionary process.

The level of positiveness of each news article is determined by FinBERT, a natural language processing model fine-tuned specifically for financial information. Supply chains of firms across the world are identified mostly by financial statements, while those of Japanese firms are taken from large-scale firm-level surveys. We find that positive news increases the change rate of stock prices of firms mentioned in the news before its disclosure, most likely because of diffusion of information through informal channels. Positive news also raises stock prices of the firms' suppliers and customers before its disclosure, confirming propagation of market values through supply chains. In addition, we generally find a larger post-news effect on stock prices of the mentioned firms and their suppliers and customers than the pre-news effect. The positive difference between the post- and pre-news effects can be considered as the net effect of the disclosure of positive news, controlling for informal information diffusion.

There are many possible criteria for a link to be considered important, and hence many methods have been developed for the task of network backboning for graph sparsification. These methods can be classified as global or local in nature depending on whether they evaluate the importance of an edge in the context of the whole network or an individual node neighborhood. A key limitation of existing network backboning methods is that they either artificially restrict the topology of the backbone to take a specific form (e.g. a tree) or they require the specification of a free parameter (e.g. a significance level) that determines the number of edges to keep in the backbone. Here we develop a completely nonparametric framework for inferring the backbone of a weighted network that overcomes these limitations by automatically selecting the optimal number of edges to retain in the backbone using the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle from information theory. We develop two encoding schemes that serve as objective functions for global and local network backbones, as well as efficient optimization algorithms to identify the optimal backbones according to these objectives with runtime complexity log-linear in the number of edges. We show that the proposed framework is generalizable to any discrete weight distribution on the edges using a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation procedure with an asymptotically equivalent Bayesian generative model of the backbone.

Here we use the Doi-Peliti approach and extend the classical deterministic SIS and SIR models to a quantum-like formalism to explore whether the uncertainty of epidemic forecasts is also shaped by the stochastic nature of epidemic processes. This approach allows getting a probabilistic ensemble of trajectories, revealing that epidemic uncertainty is not uniform across time, being maximal around the epidemic peak and vanishing at both early and very late stages of the outbreak. Our results therefore show that, independently of the models' complexity, the stochasticity of contagion and recover processes poses a natural constraint for the uncertainty of epidemic forecasts."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06660": {"title": "Memory and Personality in Ideological Polarization: The Politico-physics of Mnemomatter", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06660", "description": "arXiv:2409.06660v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We used physical agents with deep memories of past events and left/right ideologies but different fixed personalities to study what drives the polarization of the dynamic population ideology. We find that agents have a critical memory depth below which complete ideology polarization of the collective cannot occur and above which it is inevitable. However, depending on the details of the personalities, the ideologies polarization can be static or dynamic in time, even chaotic. Thus, agents with different personalities and levels of memory (mnemomatter) can serve as a physics analogue of the ideology dynamics among ideological beings, illuminating how decisions influenced by individual memories of past interactions can shape and influence subsequent ideology polarization. Each constituent agent harbors a private stack memory and an onboard microcomputer/controller which both measures and controls its physical spin handedness, which is a proxy for ideology. The agent's decision to change or retain its current spin is determined by each agent's private algorithm for decisions (the personality) and the time-weighted stack history of present and previous interactions. Depending on a given agent's personality for evaluating its memory and experiences, an agent can act as a curmudgeon who never changes its ideology, a pushover who always accepts change, a contrarian who always does the opposite of what is expected, an opportunist who weighs recent events more heavily than past events in making decisions, and a traditionalist who weighs past events more heavily than recent events in decision making. We develop a field theory which maps agent ideological polarization over into a dynamic potential landscape.

Since tasks may interfere with each other, a key notion for modeling their relationships is task affinity. This includes pairwise task affinity, computed among pairs of tasks, and higher-order affinity, computed among subsets of tasks. Naively computing either of them requires repeatedly training on data from various task combinations, which is computationally intensive. We present a new algorithm Grad-TAG that can estimate task affinities without this repeated training.\n  The key idea of Grad-TAG is to train a \"base\" model for all tasks and then use a linearization technique to estimate the loss of the model for a specific task combination. The linearization works by computing a gradient-based approximation of the loss, using low-dimensional projections of gradients as features in a logistic regression to predict labels for the task combination. We show that the linearized model can provably approximate the loss when the gradient-based approximation is accurate, and also empirically verify that on several large models. Then, given the estimated task affinity, we design a semi-definite program for clustering similar tasks by maximizing the average density of clusters.\n  We evaluate Grad-TAG's performance across seven datasets, including multi-label classification on graphs, and instruction fine-tuning of language models. Our task affinity estimates are within 2.7% distance to the true affinities while needing only 3% of FLOPs in full training. On our largest graph with 21M edges and 500 labeling tasks, our algorithm delivers estimates within 5% distance to the true affinities, using only 112 GPU hours.

This paper presents a novel node generation method that infuses a small set of high-quality synthesized nodes into the graph as additional labeled nodes to optimally expand the propagation of labeled information. By simply infusing additional nodes, the framework is orthogonal to the graph learning and downstream classification techniques, and thus is compatible with most popular graph pre-training (self-supervised learning), semi-supervised learning, and meta-learning methods. The contribution lies in designing the generated node set by solving a novel optimization problem. The optimization places the generated nodes in a manner that: (1) minimizes the classification loss to guarantee training accuracy and (2) maximizes label propagation to low-confidence nodes in the downstream task to ensure high-quality propagation.

This paper exploits class-invariant features via graph contrastive learning to discover additional high-quality features for unsupervised clustering. We formulate a novel node-level fine-grained augmentation framework for self-supervised learning, which iteratively identifies competitive contrastive samples from the whole feature spaces, in the form of positive and negative examples of node relations. While positive examples of node relations are usually expressed as edges in graph homophily, negative examples are implicit without a direct edge. We show, however, that simply sampling nodes beyond the local neighborhood results in less competitive negative pairs, that are less effective for contrastive learning. Inspired by counterfactual augmentation, we instead sample competitive negative node relations by creating virtual nodes that inherit (in a self-supervised fashion) class-invariant features, while altering class-dependent features, creating contrasting pairs that lie closer to the boundary and offering better contrast.

Existing studies rely on scale transformations conceptualized over either a definite geometric structure of the system (very often realized as length-scale transformations) or purely temporal scale transformations. However, many physical and social systems are observed as temporal interactions among agents without any definitive geometry. Yet, one can imagine the existence of an underlying notion of distance as the interactions are mostly localized. Analysing only the time-scale transformations over such systems would uncover only a limited aspect of the complexity. In this work, we propose a novel technique of scale transformation that dissects temporal interaction networks under spatio-temporal scales, namely, flow scales. Upon experimenting with multiple social and biological interaction networks, we find that many of them possess a finite fractal dimension under flow-scale transformation. Finally, we relate the emergence of flow-scale self-similarity to the latent geometry of such networks.

However, reductions in economic inequality do not necessarily correspond to reductions in demographic disparities.

We analyze tweets from 174K users over the duration of 2021 and find that demographic-free impression inequality metrics are positively correlated with gender, race, and age disparities in the average case, and weakly (but still positively) correlated with demographic bias in the worst case. We therefore recommend inequality metrics as a potentially useful proxy measure of average group-wise disparities, especially in cases where such disparities cannot be measured directly.

It identifies the outlier nodes that exhibit deviation from the majority in the graph. One of the fundamental challenges confronting supervised graph outlier detection algorithms is the prevalent issue of class imbalance, where the scarcity of outlier instances compared to normal instances often results in suboptimal performance. Conventional methods mitigate the imbalance by reweighting instances in the estimation of the loss function, assigning higher weights to outliers and lower weights to inliers. Nonetheless, these strategies are prone to overfitting and underfitting, respectively. Recently, generative models, especially diffusion models, have demonstrated their efficacy in synthesizing high-fidelity images.

However, the nature of that growth - whether exponential or otherwise - remains controversial, perhaps partly due to the lack of quantitative characterizations. We evaluated knowledge as a collective thinking structure, using citation networks as a representation, by examining extensive datasets that include 213 million publications (1800-2020) and 7.6 million patents (1976-2020). We found that knowledge - which we conceptualize as the reduction of uncertainty in a knowledge network - grew linearly over time in naturally formed citation networks that themselves expanded exponentially. Moreover, our results revealed inflection points in the growth of knowledge that often corresponded to important developments within fields, such as major breakthroughs, new paradigms, or the emergence of entirely new areas of study. Around these inflection points, knowledge may grow rapidly or exponentially on a local scale, although the overall growth rate remains linear when viewed globally. Previous studies concluding an exponential growth of knowledge may have focused primarily on these local bursts of rapid growth around key developments, leading to the misconception of a global exponential trend. Our findings help to reconcile the discrepancy between the perceived exponential growth and the actual linear growth of knowledge by highlighting the distinction between local and global growth patterns.

Drawing on nine-month ethnographic work conducted online, we find that the production of the KOC role on RED is predicated on the interactions and negotiations among multiple stakeholders -- content creators, marketers, consumer brands (corporations), and the platform. KOCs are instrumental in RED influencer marketing tactics and amplify the mundane and daily life content popular on the platform. They navigate the dynamics in the triangulated relations with other stakeholders in order to secure economic opportunities for producing advertorial content, and yet, the labor involved in producing such content is deliberately obscured to make it appear as spontaneous, ordinary user posts for the sake of marketing campaigns. Meanwhile, the commercial value of their work is often underestimated and overshadowed in corporate paperwork, platform technological mechanisms, and business models, resulting in and reinforcing inadequate recognition and compensation of KOCs. We propose the concept of ``informal labor'' to offer a new lens to understand content creation labor that is indispensable yet unrecognized by the social media industry.

However, these ties are not all of equal strength; for example, we often are connected to good friends or family members as well as acquaintances. Inferring the tie strengths is an essential task in social network analysis. Common approaches classify the ties into strong and weak edges based on the network topology using the strong triadic closure (STC). The STC states that if for three nodes, $\\textit{A}$, $\\textit{B}$, and $\\textit{C}$, there are strong ties between $\\textit{A}$ and $\\textit{B}$, as well as $\\textit{A}$ and $\\textit{C}$, there has to be a (weak or strong) tie between $\\textit{B}$ and $\\textit{C}$. Moreover, a variant of the STC called STC+ allows adding new weak edges to obtain improved solutions. Recently, the focus of social network analysis has been shifting from single-layer to multilayer networks due to their ability to represent complex systems with multiple types of interactions or relationships in multiple social network platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn, or X (formerly Twitter). However, straightforwardly applying the STC separately to each layer of multilayer networks usually leads to inconsistent labelings between layers. Avoiding such inconsistencies is essential as they contradict the idea that tie strengths represent underlying, consistent truths about the relationships between users. Therefore, we adapt the definitions of the STC and STC+ for multilayer networks and provide ILP formulations to solve the problems exactly. Solving the ILPs is computationally costly; hence, we additionally provide an efficient 2-approximation for the STC and a 6-approximation for the STC+ minimization variants. The experiments show that, unlike standard approaches, our new highly efficient algorithms lead to consistent strong/weak labelings of the multilayer network edges."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08459": {"title": "Toward satisfactory public accessibility: A crowdsourcing approach through online reviews to inclusive urban design", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08459", "description": "arXiv:2409.08459v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: As urban populations grow, the need for accessible urban design has become urgent.

Many real-world networks are directed and temporal, where edges have timestamps. Motif counting in directed, temporal graphs is especially challenging because there are a plethora of different kinds of patterns. Temporal motif counts reveal much richer information and there is a need for scalable algorithms for motif counting.\n  A major challenge in counting is that there can be trillions of temporal motif matches even with a graph with only millions of vertices. Both the motifs and the input graphs can have multiple edges between two vertices, leading to a combinatorial explosion problem. Counting temporal motifs involving just four vertices is not feasible with current state-of-the-art algorithms.\n  We design an algorithm, TEACUPS, that addresses this problem using a novel technique of temporal path sampling. We combine a path sampling method with carefully designed temporal data structures, to propose an efficient approximate algorithm for temporal motif counting. TEACUPS is an unbiased estimator with provable concentration behavior, which can be used to bound the estimation error. For a Bitcoin graph with hundreds of millions of edges, TEACUPS runs in less than 1 minute, while the exact counting algorithm takes more than a day.

Our DELTA consists of an edge-oriented graph subnetwork and a path-oriented graph subnetwork, which can explore topological semantics from complementary perspectives. In particular, our edge-oriented graph subnetwork utilizes the message passing mechanism to learn neighborhood information, while our path-oriented graph subnetwork explores high-order relationships from substructures. To jointly learn from two subnetworks, we roughly select informative candidate nodes with the consideration of consistency across two subnetworks. Then, we aggregate local semantics from its K-hop subgraph based on node degrees for topological uncertainty estimation.

Lower openness to interdisciplinary collaborations may be compensated by a higher ability to collaborate with multiple peers, but low openness also neutralises the intrinsic benefits of network heterogeneity.
