These representations have widespread applications in recommendation systems and advertising; however, existing methods typically rely on specific features like text content, activity patterns, or platform metadata, failing to holistically model user behavior across different modalities. To address this limitation, we propose SoMeR, a Social Media user Representation learning framework that incorporates temporal activities, text content, profile information, and network interactions to learn comprehensive user portraits. SoMeR encodes user post streams as sequences of timestamped textual features, uses transformers to embed this along with profile data, and jointly trains with link prediction and contrastive learning objectives to capture user similarity. We demonstrate SoMeR's versatility through two applications: 1) Identifying inauthentic accounts involved in coordinated influence operations by detecting users posting similar content simultaneously, and 2) Measuring increased polarization in online discussions after major events by quantifying how users with different beliefs moved farther apart in the embedding space. SoMeR's ability to holistically model users enables new solutions to important problems around disinformation, societal tensions, and online behavior understanding."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05288": {"title": "Learning Social Graph for Inactive User Recommendation", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05288", "description": "arXiv:2405.05288v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Social relations have been widely incorporated into recommender systems to alleviate data sparsity problem.

In this paper, we propose a novel social recommendation method called LSIR (\\textbf{L}earning \\textbf{S}ocial Graph for \\textbf{I}nactive User \\textbf{R}ecommendation) that learns an optimal social graph structure for social recommendation, especially for inactive users. LSIR recursively aggregates user and item embeddings to collaboratively encode item and user features.

Meanwhile, mimic learning is implemented to guide active users in mimicking inactive users during model training, which improves the construction of new edges for inactive users. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that LSIR achieves significant improvements of up to 129.58\\% on NDCG in inactive user recommendation.

As argued recently, however, the mutual information as conventionally defined can return biased results because it neglects the information cost of the so-called contingency table, a crucial component of the similarity calculation. In principle the bias can be rectified by subtracting the appropriate information cost, leading to the modified measure known as the reduced mutual information, but in practice one can only ever compute an upper bound on this information cost, and the value of the reduced mutual information depends crucially on how good a bound is established. In this paper we describe an improved method for encoding contingency tables that gives a substantially better bound in typical use cases, and approaches the ideal value in the common case where the labelings are closely similar, as we demonstrate with extensive numerical results."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05400": {"title": "Comparative analysis of graph randomization: Tools,methods, pitfalls, and best practices", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05400", "description": "arXiv:2405.05400v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Graph randomization techniques play a crucial role in network analysis, allowing researchers to assess the statistical significance of observed network properties and distinguish meaningful patterns from random fluctuations.

We find a trade-off between the level of cooperation and evolutionary stability influenced by social norms. `Forgiving' recipient norms enhance cooperation but increase susceptibility to defectors, whereas `unforgiving' norms reduce cooperation but defend against invasion by defectors. Expanding to include gossip groups allows us to analyze the evolutionary dynamics of the time-scale parameter, identifying `generous' norms that support cooperation, and `strict' norms that discourage such generosity, ultimately showing vulnerability to defector invasions and potential cooperation collapse."}, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05433": {"title": "Robust Reward Placement under Uncertainty", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05433", "description": "arXiv:2405.05433v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Reward placement is a common optimization problem in network diffusion processes, where a number of rewards are to be placed in a network so as to maximize the total reward obtained as agents move randomly in it. In many settings, the precise mobility network might be one of several possible, based on parameters outside our control, such as the weather conditions affecting peoples' transportation means. Solutions to the reward placement problem must thus be robust to this uncertainty, by achieving a high utility in all possible networks. To study such scenarios, we introduce the Robust Reward Placement problem (RRP). Agents move randomly on a Markovian Mobility Model that has a predetermined set of locations but its precise connectivity is unknown and chosen adversarialy from a known set $\\Pi$ of candidates. Network optimization is achieved by selecting a set of reward states, and the goal is to maximize the minimum, among all candidates, ratio of rewards obtained over the optimal solution for each candidate. We first prove that RRP is NP-hard and inapproximable in general.

However, vaccine hesitancy (VH) complicates disease spread prediction and healthcare resource assessment across regions and populations. We propose a modeling framework that integrates an epidemiological compartmental model that captures the spread of an infectious disease within a multi-stage stochastic program (MSP) that determines the allocation of critical resources under uncertainty. The proposed compartmental MSP model adaptively manages the allocation of resources to account for changes in population behavior toward vaccines (i.e., variability in VH), the unique patterns of disease spread, and the availability of healthcare resources over time and space. The compartmental MSP model allowed us to analyze the price of fairness in resource allocation. Using real COVID-19 vaccination and healthcare resource data from Arkansas, U.S. (January-May 2021), our findings include: (i) delaying the initial deployment of additional ventilators by one month could lead to an average increase in the expected number of deaths by 285.41/month, highlighting the importance of prompt action; (ii) each additional ventilator in the initial stockpile and in supply leads to a decrease in the expected number of deaths by 1.09/month and 0.962/month, respectively, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a large stockpile and scalable production response; (iii) the cost of ensuring equitable resource allocation varies over time and location, peaking during the peak of a disease outbreak and in densely populated areas.

These results relate the graph spectrum (eigenvalues of the normalized adjacency matrix) to the ability to break a graph into two pieces, with few edge deletions. An entire subfield of mathematics, called spectral graph theory, has emerged from these results. Yet these results do not say anything about the rich community structure exhibited by real-world networks, which typically have a significant fraction of edges contained in numerous densely clustered blocks. Inspired by the properties of real-world networks, we discover a new spectral condition that relates eigenvalue powers to a network decomposition into densely clustered blocks. We call this the \\emph{spectral triadic decomposition}. Our relationship exactly predicts the existence of community structure, as commonly seen in real networked data. Our proof provides an efficient algorithm to produce the spectral triadic decomposition.

To reach our goal we build a multiplex temporal network and we perform dynamic community detection to identify groups of users that exhibited coordinated behaviors in time. Thanks to our novel approach we find that: (i) coordinated communities feature variable degrees of temporal instability; (ii) dynamic analyses are needed to account for such instability, and results of static analyses can be unreliable and scarcely representative of unstable communities; (iii) some users exhibit distinct archetypal behaviors that have important practical implications; (iv) content and network characteristics contribute to explaining why users leave and join coordinated communities.

As individuals travel, possibilities to encounter new people either at the final destination or during the transportation process appear. Such contacts can lead to new contagion events. In fact, mobility has been a crucial target for early non-pharmaceutical containment measures against the recent COVID-19 pandemic, with a degree of intensity ranging from public transportation line closures to regional, city or even home confinements. Nonetheless, quantitative knowledge on the relationship between mobility-contagions and, consequently, on the efficiency of containment measures remains elusive. Here we introduce an agent-based model with a simple interaction between mobility and contacts. Despite its simplicity our model shows the emergence of a critical mobility level, inducing major outbreaks when surpassed. We explore the interplay between mobility restrictions and the infection in recent intervention policies seen across many countries, and how interventions in the form of closures triggered by incidence rates can guide the epidemic into an oscillatory regime with recurrent waves. We consider how the different interventions impact societal well-being, the economy and the population.
